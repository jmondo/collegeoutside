    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello and Welcome to College Outside!

This blog is a brainchild born from many hours of discussion on the trail, and I decided that it's time to put my plan into action.

As a college student, I get all of my know-how from my friends, or from learning from my mistakes. But for many things in the outdoors, mistakes can have a big cost. I wanted to create a place where the student community can come together and share stories, tips, and information on how to successfully be an outdoorsman while in school. Some posts will be directed at city kids who think that Keds are ok hiking footwear, others at more experienced students who want to give and share tips.

So what makes College Outside different from every other gear/trip/outdoor junkie website? Essentially it comes down to this: there is a difference between being a mountaineer and a mountaineer in college, a hiker and a weekend college hiker, a climber and going to the local gym once a week. There are plenty of movies, articles, and blogs out there for the average outdoorsman, and although college students may follow this advice (as I do), the average student can't afford $450 mountaineering boots for their first winter hike. This is an attempt to decode the outdoor world for the average, broke-ass, college student in a way that makes the outdoors safer and more accesible that ever before.

For now, I will be writing all of the posts, from gear reviews to workout and food tips, trip descriptions and awesome-people profiles. I'll also try to address many of the things that may be too awkward to talk about (pooping on the trail, smoke screens, smoke tents, forgetting TP, etc.) In the near future however, some of my future outdoors men and women will be guest posting to share more info than my Hawaii-goes-to-New Hampshire self can.

In the mean time, enjoy, share, ask questions! If you have anything you're curious about, or would like to know more about, please email me or leave a comment and I'll dedicate a whole post to it.

Go outside!

    <title>Guide to Cheap Gear</title>
    <link>http://www.collegeoutside.com/how-to-acquire-cheap-gear/</link>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok let's be real. I procrastinate by reading Outside Magazine's Best Gear of the Year and get more excited when I receive the monthly Patagonia magazine than a 15 year old girl does when she receives a Cosmo. But most of it is fantasy. I have a pinterest board with more gear on it than I could ever use, and am constantly on the look out for great deals, since most of my gear fondling stops before my debit card comes out. There are a few things that are necessary when attaining gear at a fraction of the cost: patience, persistance, and an ungodly willingness to wake up at 4am.

Tip Number #1: <strong>The REI Used Gear Sale.</strong> They happen four times a year, and if you weren't an REI member before, these four events make it worth it. Essentially, they are a time for REI to re-sell all the gear and clothing that has been returned at a fraction of the price. Most things will be tagged as "broken" or "used", but most items are either brand new, used once, or totally fixable. The down side? Although the store will open up at 10am, the line usually starts forming around 5am. So go to sleep early, bring a warm sleeping bag, some friends, and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJB36lVJI8&amp;feature=related">plan</a>. I've scored an<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/780220/osprey-aura-50-pack-womens"> Osprey Aura 50 liters</a> for $50, a down jacket with a small hole that patched with ShoeGoo (waterproof and bombproof), trekking poles, etc. You get the point.

Tip #2:<strong> <a href="http://www.theclymb.com/invite-from/SarahLockwood">TheClymb.com</a></strong>. A fantastic site with discounted gear whose velvet rope needs only an email to get through. They have daily and weekly deals and will email you as soon as a new one comes out.

Tip #3: <strong><a href="http://hrtapps.com/odatmac/">ODAT Tracker</a></strong>. Any respectable gear junkie already has steapandcheap.com as their home page, but ODAT tracker is a free app you can download from the itunes app store that is 10x better. It follows backcountry.com's one deal at a time sites (ODAT sites) as well as the daily deals from many other companies. Perfect for those of us with gear ADD.

Happy Shopping!

    <title>What to Wear: Winter Hiking</title>
    <link>http://www.collegeoutside.com/what-to-wear-winter-hiking/</link>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Winter hiking involves a bit more preparation than your average summer hike. A water bottle and PB&amp;J won't cut it, principally for safety reasons. I'm going to go through the layers that I would wear as well as the things I would bring with me on an average winter day hike. (The brands are of course interchangeable, and everyone finds a system that works for them, but these are the basics.)

<img class="alignright  wp-image-59" title="2113011-1" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2113011-11-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />

*For a bottom and top baselayer, I usually wear Under Armour Cold-Gear. They are synthetic, sweat wicking layers that will dry quickly, but more importantly, keep you warm even when they get wet. Any sort of synthetic (not cotton) base layer will work.

*Over the base layers, I put on water/wind proof pants. You don't really need to buy anything new, your snowboarding/ski/rain pants will do just fine.

[caption id="attachment_55" align="alignright" width="130" caption="Patagonia R1"]<img class="wp-image-55  " title="35607541" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/35607541-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="130" />[/caption]

*Up top I put on a micro fleece (my personal favorite is the Patagonia R1)  and then a down or synthetic filled jacket, followed by either a hard or soft shell (like your rain jacket). The shell is important to keep the wind/snow out. Ten minutes into your hike, you'll be so warm you'llprobably strip down to your base layer and fleece. A down jacket can be replaced by many layers of fleece for smaller day hikes, although a down is lighter and packs down smaller in your bag.

&nbsp;

*Wool socks are crucial to keep your feet warm, again no cotton, and of course a hat and gloves.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-60" title="40110" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/40110-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" />

*Microspikes, snowshoes, <a href="http://www.rei.com/gear/feature/search/Google_Climbing/crampons?s_kwcid=TC|13029|crampons||S|p|9577326365&amp;cm_mmc=ps_google_action-_-Category%20-%20Climbing_TOF-_-Climbing_Gear_Crampons_General-_-crampons&amp;gclid=CMSFwMial60CFasaQgodhmhtmA">crampons</a>, or any type of traction for your feet is crucial. It will allow you to conquer any ice on the trail that would otherwise turn you away.

[caption id="attachment_57" align="alignright" width="144" caption="Microspikes, they run about $60, $50 with a 20% off student discount at EMS"]<img class=" wp-image-57 " style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="fa4070ad-1ede-4a9a-90a2-76ebd4ee12a0" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fa4070ad-1ede-4a9a-90a2-76ebd4ee12a0-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="114" />[/caption]

*<a href="http://www.rei.com/search?brand=REI&amp;search=gators">Gators</a> are a good thing to have if you can get a good deal on them. They keep the snow out of your boots and your feet dry in snow. They also keep your crampons from catching your pants and ripping a huge hole in them.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">In your pack, you should have:</span>

-Extra socks

-Plenty of water (put an extra sock around your Nalgenes to keep it from freezing).

-Twice the amount of food that you normally would. Your body burns way more calories in the winter trying to keep warm as it does in the summer.

-A <a href="http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3781637">first aid kit </a>of course! You can pick up a basic kit at EMS or REI for under $15. In a crunch, an ace bandage and a bottle of ibuprofen will do.

-A headlamp, map, compass, and of course, some chocolate.

Patagonia has some great <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/systems/hiking-trekking?k=3h">technical systems on their website </a>to give you some more ideas, but most things can be replaced with less expensive versions.

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Remember that if you use a camelback to blow the water back through the tube into the bladder because the tube will freeze EVEN IF IT'S "INSULATED".  An alternative to this that works great is taking one of the camelbacks that you can use as a backpack (shoulder and chest straps), wear it backwards under your jacket (i.e. on your chest outside of a few base layers) and then run the tube down your arm and secure it to your wrist with an elastic, hair tie, or watch and then put your jacket on over the top.  With this system it keeps your bladder from freezing and when you're thirsty you just drink from your wrist, pretty ninja.  I stole this tactic from a Navy Seal and it worked like a charm for last winter's ascent of Mt. Katahdin in Maine, I've been using it ever since.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>The Ultimate PB&amp;J</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[There are only so many Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches you can eat in your life time, before you start dreaming peanut butter flavored dreams. I, personally, can not eat them outside of an outdoors-y setting, but they are still my go-to when hiking/climbing/snowboarding etc. The jelly has a quick sugar boost, and the bread and protein from the peanut butter keep me going all day long. However, after hundreds and hundreds of PB&amp;J's, I finally started to get creative, and with the help of some friends, we came up with some winning combinations:

1) PB&amp;J not fill you up enough? ADD MORE PEANUT BUTTER. Both sides, as much as you dare. Warning: This may happen to you ----&gt;

[caption id="attachment_80" align="alignright" width="300" caption="It all ends up in the same place, right?"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/264753_701156714178_1708220_37140081_7594308_n1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-80" title="264753_701156714178_1708220_37140081_7594308_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/264753_701156714178_1708220_37140081_7594308_n1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

2) The Class PB&amp;J + cereal. This is similar to a turkey sandwich with chips. It adds crunch and flavor. My favorites including adding Peanut Butter Captain Crunch, honey nut cheerios, and coco-puffs, but any cereal will do. Warning: the cereal will get soggy after a couple of hours, so plan on this being your first snack and/or breakfast.

3) Try adding any sort of instant drink to it: hot coco, instant coffee, Tang, or open up a tea bag if you're desperate. These will give you an extra sugar or caffeine burst, as well as taste delicious.

In any case, make sure to put peanut butter on both sides of the bread, and then add the jelly, it will keep it from getting soggy and from the jelly going everywhere. Any other suggestions?

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I recommend putting Doritos in the PB&amp;J.  Cool ranch is the best, cheddar is ok, I still prefer crunchy filling to the standard PB&amp;J any day.  Also, tea bags and instant coffee is gross, tang and/or coolaid mix sprinkled around inside is incredible.  Great post!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>My First (Free) Triathlon</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last summer was my first summer spent in Boston. I had a full time job in the city and so in order to keep myself sane, I became a true weekend warrior. For 10 weeks, I did not spend one weekend in Boston. Most weekends were spent in New Hampshire or Maine hiking or climbing, but one weekend was spent on Cape Code for <a href="http://www.newenglandtritour.com/#!__falmouth-sprint-triathlon">my first sprint triathlon.</a> I had been convinced to sign up for this race six months before hand; July 17<sup>th</sup>seemed so far away. I liked the idea of having something legit to train for. I was already a decent swimmer, would run 5 miles if I had to, and biking’s not that hard, right?

[caption id="attachment_114" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Triathletes...or something"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/P1030365.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-114" title="P1030365" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/P1030365-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>[/caption]

The downside? It would cost me around $85 to sign up. There was no way in hell that I was going to pay that much to exercise. I feel that this is a common theme with a lot of the cool races I want to do: they’re just too expensive. However, whether it’s a <a href="http://www.spartanrace.com/">Spartan Race,</a> <a href="http://peakraces.com/">Snowshoe race</a>, or triathlon, there is always a way to get a discount or to get away with doing them for free! This is my account of my first sprint triathlon, which I got away with being legitimately registered without paying a dime.

[caption id="attachment_113" align="alignright" width="179" caption="Handing out t-shirts before the race."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/280577_553317590428_47701687_31334258_7313842_o1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-113" title="280577_553317590428_47701687_31334258_7313842_o" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/280577_553317590428_47701687_31334258_7313842_o1-179x300.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

As all races go, there are early bird specials, and last minute registration penalties, and of course I waited until the last minute to sign up. The four people I was going to do it with were already registered, but by the time I tried to sign up, the race was already full! Desperate, I emailed and called the race organizers, with pleas of “but I’m a student and this is my first tri!” and “but all my friends are already signed up!” These pathetic attempts did not of course work, but in this case, persistence paid off. The race organizer told me that if I volunteered to help with packet handout and registration the day before, I could have a spot in the race.

The bonus? Volunteers race for free. WIN! I spent the day before the race on the beach, handing out t-shirts and packets and getting to see all of my competition.

Race day was fantastic. It was an open water swim, AKA my forte (I can’t say the same for a couple of my friends who probably would have drowned without their wetsuits), scenic bike loop over gently rolling terrain, and flat gorgeous 5k run along the beach’s bike path.

There are definitely expensive parts to a triathlon aside from the registration fee: principally the gear. However, being my first tri, and with no pressure to win, I didn’t care if I had the top of the line, or even proper gear. Being from Hawaii, I pride myself on being able to swim in any conditions, with no aid. Therefore, while everyone else wore a wetsuit, I wore a bikini top and pink tri-shorts that I had bought on <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/?p=21">TheClymb</a>. I wore my running shoes to bike in which helped speed up my second transition, although probably cost me some time on the bike. Also, my piece of crap 1980’s road bike that I had bought from a friend literally fell apart in the middle of the race. The seat basically exploded, which I somehow managed to put back together with some Allen wrenches, despite my shaking, endorphin filled hands.

Yet despite this disaster, I had the time of my life. Sure I didn’t finish in any sort of standing, and I didn’t have the best or newest gear, but hey, I’m now a Triathlete right?

<em>Summary:</em> Consider volunteering to get free entry, and borrowing/renting gear instead of buying gear to make race day financially painless!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>How Not Buying Fancy Gear Can Save More Money Then You Ever Imagined</strong>

I started telemarking when all my friends thought getting down the bunny hill without falling meant you were good at snowboarding. I needed something to keep me interested, and hey, who doesn’t like being at the bottom of the learning curve. It is also a handy skill to have when you go on your annual family ski vacation and there is absolutely no snow and you can’t face one more round of bridge with the grandfather. Oh yeah, and its pretty rad in the backcountry.

The snow was so unbelievably nonexistent that my mom and I didn’t bring our skis with us and we decided we would rent if and when we hit the slopes. So day one of the ski trip, we ducked into Alpenglow sports in Tahoe City, and picked up matching pairs of Black Diamond Embers.<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-29-at-8.55.43-PM.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-97" title="Screen shot 2011-12-29 at 8.55.43 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-29-at-8.55.43-PM-164x300.png" alt="" width="164" height="300" /></a>

<strong>Cost to Rent: </strong>With boots and poles, $49/day, $27/day for just the skies

<strong>Cost to buy them?</strong> $589, no bindings. (Check out <a href="http://www.evo.com/">http://www.evo.com</a>, <a href="http://galacticsnowsports.com/">http://galacticsnowsports.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.levelninesports.com/">http://www.levelninesports.com</a> for online deals.)

<strong>What BD says:</strong>

The all-new Black Diamond Ember is designed from the ground up for women who want an everyday, all-mountain ski for frontside terrain. Its 3D Sandwich construction offers up precision turns on firm snow, plus a light and lively feel thanks to its poplar wood core. A deep sidecut and wide, soft flexing tip make for an easy-turning ski ideal for any day short of a full-on powder fest.
<ul>
  <li>95 mm waist, full-length camber, and women's-specific flex for lively, snappy feel out of every turn</li>
  <li>Traditional tip and tail rise offer full-length edge contact and maximum stability</li>
  <li>More sidecut, lighter and easier turning at any speed than the Verdict</li>
  <li>3D Sandwich poplar wood core with ABS tapered sidewalls for maximum energy return</li>
  <li>Dual Torsion Bow Technology with two ribs puts power to the edges from tip to tail</li>
</ul>
Optimal use: 40% soft snow / 60% hard snow

<strong>
</strong>

<strong>What I, (MD 20/20) say:</strong>

As the surfer-cum-ski bum adjusted my bindings, he dropped the casual “these are pretty skinny for Squaw, but you should be fine because there isn’t much snow”. The Embers are 95 mm underfoot. Compared to the 71 m waist on the Karhu Outbounds I usually tele on, these were freakin’ water skis. That aside, I decided to give them a go.

At 7 lbs 8 oz, you could find lighter skis, or you could find heavier, but for my walk from the car to the lift line, I barely noticed them on my shoulder. Nothing dramatic about putting them on, other than the usual struggle of finding my way around a new binding system (TwentyTwo Designs Axle’s, for those of you who are interested. They get a thumbs up). Once on the snow (all 12” of it), the skis were great. Too great. I could be way off balance, throw my hip into the hill, not buckle the waist belt of my pack and the massive side cut still bite into the slope. It was awesome. I am not the world’s greatest telemarker, but I was carving turns and implementing the hop like it was nobody’s business. And when I got lazy, the skis almost begged me to make an alpine turn. The tips on these babies are so soft, they coax you into keeping you weight forward, which is great, if your heels are attached. I felt as though I had to work to keep my weight centered enough to drop a knee, but this was mostly masked by the ease with which the Embers turned.

[caption id="attachment_98" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Squaw Valley is Beautiful. 0&quot; of snow is not."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_3433.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98 " title="IMG_3433" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_3433-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

The bottom line: You can probably find something cheaper that will make you a better skier at your neighborhood ski swap (save on gear and lessons!). They are great on hard pack, but I feel like they might act a bit hung-over (read: “sluggish and unresponsive”) in serious powpow. If you want a ski that will let you mess up and still make it through the turn standing and if you were to primarily telemark inbounds on hardpack/corduroy and/or are new to the sport of telemarking, these skis are for you. That being said, if you are looking to get into telemarking, or go to school near some big resorts, AND you can pick up a used/discounted pair, you and the Embers will have a rowdy time. BUT...I would skimp on the skis and splurge on the boots. However, you can find your self a good, safe tele set up minus boots for about $200-$300 online or at your local ski shop.

Editor’s note: Considering renting the skis first, and then if you fall in love, most ski shops will sell you those rental skis and a much discounted price.]]></content:encoded>

    <title>Adventure Books for Christmas Break</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Christmas vacation is always a well needed break from a heavy semester. It's a time to sleep in, eat some good home cooking, ski your face off, and of course, read some great books that will whet your appetite for future adventures. Here are a few of my favorites:

<strong>On the Ridge Between Life and Death</strong> by David Roberts

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-105" title="103509733" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/103509733-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" />

What compels mountain climbers to take the risks that they do? Is it the thrill in the physical accomplishment, in managing to defy the odds, or both — and why do they continue to do what they do in the face of such great danger? In On the Ridge Between Life and Death, David Roberts confronts these questions head-on as he recounts

the exhilarating highs and desperate lows of his climbing career. By the time he was twenty-two, Roberts had already been involved in three fatal mountain climbing accidents and had escaped death himself by the sheerest of luck. And yet, as he acknowledges, few things have brought him more joy than climbing.

In a world before Gortex, cams, and Freedom of the Hills, there were mountaineers and adventurers who pushed the limits in some of the harshest and most remote conditions on the planet. David Roberts is certainly one of those individuals. This book is a must read for any aspiring, intermediate, or seasoned hiker/climber/mountaineer. (Side note: Roberts was a mentor to Krakauer, very cool.) This book was given to me by someone who taught me to respect climbing for the dangerous and beautiful sport that it is.

<strong>Into Thin Air</strong> By Jon Krakauer

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-106" title="200px-Into_Thin_Air" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/200px-Into_Thin_Air.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="289" />

Into Thin Air is a personal account of the disaster that occurred near the summit of Everest in May of 1996, when five expeditioners perished in a massive Everest scale storm. Initially, Krakauer, a journalist for adventure magazine Outside, stated that his intentions to climb Everest were purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to base camp, and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire for climbing the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book chronologically moves between events that take place on the mountain and the unfolding tragedy which takes place during the push to the summit.

Krakauer takes his us inside both the drive and the disaster that accompanies climbing Mount Everest. But he also takes us within himself as he relates not only his physical experiences on Everest, but his emotional experiences and the toll the 1996 disaster had on his life. You will truly be immersed in his harsh Himalayan lifestyle.

<strong><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/9781559709026.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-107" title="9781559709026" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/9781559709026.jpeg" alt="" width="176" height="240" /></a>Swimming with Crocodiles</strong> by Will Chaffey

Will Chaffey was 18 when he boarded a plane in New York bound for Australia. He had no acceptance letters from colleges and no plan. Will soon meets an enigmatic wanderer and herpetologist named Geoff there and with him crossed the inland desert to the tropical northwest coast, home to the saltwater crocodile, a predator surviving from the age of dinosaurs and a known man-eater. Together they devised a plan to explore the remote Prince Regent River, a trek so dangerous it had never been attempted by white men. Passing through harsh, primeval country, shadowed by Aborigines, and physically worn down, they find themselves locked in a life-and-death struggle when their food runs out and, unable to leave, they are stalked by a hungry crocodile.

Swimming with Crocodiles is both a riveting adventure and a wry meditation on the journey to adulthood. Beautifully written, it brims with curiosity and wonder at the natural world, with a nice balance between appreciation of the Australian outback, and a healthy fear of it’s dangers. If you haven't yet been down under, this will surely put Australian on your list of go-to places.

<strong>Into the Wild</strong> by Jon Krakauer

In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself.Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter…

For those of you who have seen the movie or even if you haven't, reading this book is a must. Not only is it more precise account, but it gives an in depth look into the boy known as Alexander Supertramp’s hopes, desires, and motives. To me, he represents the wanderer in all of us that seeks to find meaning in life.

Happy New Year everyone! Hope 2012 is as crazy as 2011 was. It has some big shoes to fill!]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_126" align="aligncenter" width="203" caption="Sweet heel hook when the bottom of the ice broke off."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0872.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-126 " title="DSCF0872" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0872-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="270" /></a>[/caption]

About this time last year, I spent my first winter break in Durango, Colorado, home to every sport imaginable and the most unstable snowpack in the country. Durango is a small town located in Southwest Colorado, a 7-hour drive from Denver, but most notably, a 1.5 hour drive along the Million Dollar Highway to Ouray (in the summer that is).

[caption id="attachment_124" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Gorgeous view, terrifying drive"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0815.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-124" title="DSCF0815" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0815-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

Ouray is home to the world-famous<a href="http://ourayicepark.com/"> Ouray Ice Park</a> where they hold a 3-day Ice Festival every year. Due to bad timing, I won’t be able to make it this year, but since today is the first day of the festival and competition, I was feeling nostalgic. I had heard about it last year, but there was no way in hell I was going to drive the 70 miles, along narrow winding roads, in one of the coldest winters Durango has every had. They call it the Million Dollar Highway for its breathtaking views of the Rockies, its canyons and peaks, made especially brilliant as a frozen winter wonderland. The view is particularly good on the road’s most precarious parts due to a steep cliff on one side and no railing on the other side, with a drop off that makes you pray that no one will be driving in the opposite direction.

I’m uncomfortable even driving down my driveway if it is the least bit icy, and so I went in search of a ride. I spent a few hours in Backcountry Experience, one of the local gear junkie stores in town, trying on ice climbing boots that were way out of my price range, and eventually started talking to the guys that worked there about the festival. I casually mentioned that I was looking for a ride up, and although they themselves weren’t going, they had a friend that was. Long story short, I ended up standing on a random girl’s doorstep at 4:30 am, with the mantra DIFTS (do it for the story) running through my head.

Turns out that the four people I was heading up with were Fort Lewis College seniors or recent graduates who were nasty backcountry skiers, and novice ice climbers like myself.  The drive ended up taking us 4 hours in horrid conditions, but once we got there it was worth it.

[caption id="attachment_125" align="alignleft" width="225" caption="A view of the ice canyon, with the sponsor&#39;s tents up above."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0831.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-125" title="DSCF0831" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DSCF0831-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

All I had brought with me was a harness and my helmet, but every major ice climbing brand from Scarpa to La Sportiva to Black Diamond was there, and I was soon demoing (for free) those super fly, light green, <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/la-sportiva-nepal-evo-gtx-mountaineering-boot-womens">La Sportiva Nepal EVOs</a> that I had been trying on the day before. (They were magic by the way. Maybe one day I’ll deserve them.) In addition, Black Diamond hooked me up with a pair of shiny crampons and ice tools, and Patagonia let me demo a sexy red hard shell that fit perfectly over my helmet and down jacket. Once we were all geared up, we made our way down into the ice canyon of my dreams. I had never seen so much perfect ice in my life. Some of it was man made, but all in all, it was the ultimate ice playground. There were top-ropes set up everywhere and soon we hooked up with a group that was more than willing to let us climb with them.

This was only my second or third time ice climbing ever, but the people there were extremely supportive, ready to teach, and more importantly, ready to party. Once the festival ends, Ouray turns into a massive celebration of outdoorsmen, novice and professional, who are just pumped for another excellent ice season.

Festivals like this one are an excellent opportunity for ice climbers of all experience levels to try out the sport and really get to know what it’s about. With all the free gear you could ask for to demo, what’s not to love?]]></content:encoded>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Cool post. Like the story and the reflection on gear and the experience.

I wonder what you find important in all of this. You said something like "This was only my second or third time ice climbing ever, but the people there were extremely supportive, ready to teach, and more importantly, ready to party". I think it was for effect (saying more importantly), but I imagine that ice climbing is not for partying.

So, question... why do you like ice climbing? Why are you intrigued by it? And why should anyone else give it a shot?

That's sort've 2.5 questions. But yeah.

Thoughtfully,
~Sean]]></wp:comment_content>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[I used to feel that my love of the outdoors was like a fleeting romance, a four year fling that I would have to painfully push aside as I entered the "real' world. I experienced a taste of this lack luster breakup last summer when I worked a 40-hour a week internship in downtown Boston. Sure, I left to go up North every single weekend that summer, but I found myself daydreaming of my next weekend trip, and making packing lists on monday afternoon.

If you're one of the lucky few who has found a paying job in the outdoor industry during the summer, we envy you. But if you're like many students who are pressured to put their summer camp days to rest to work for a more traditional 9-5, there are ways to keep your outside spirit kindled. The key is to become a weekend warrior.

Make every weekend count! Make sure you start scheduling events and trips even before your break starts. That way, you'll never waste a weekend.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[This past summer I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Alaska and sea kayak for 2.5 weeks in Prince William Sound.  It was an great chance to learn how to paddle, navigate, and how to camp on a beach.  However, there was one skill we did not have time to learn... rolling a kayak.  I had seen it done, but didnt have the chance to give it a try.  So, when I got home I sat in front of my computer and watched a few hours of youtube instructional videos.  Then I took my family's kayak 20 feet off the shore in Wellfleet harbor and rolled over.  It took a few days, but finally, somehow, I was able to complete the flip.  Hopefully this is not a skill you will need to use when sea kayak - if the waves are that big, get out of the water.  However, for those of you looking to do some white water kayaking its definitely a skill you are going to want (unless you like swimming in rapids).

Ive attached some videos to this post so you can see what it looks like to fail.  As one could imagine, sitting upside down in a boat is not the most comfortable experience.  My recommendation to you is to get used to it - the more comfortable you are hanging out in the water the easier it will be for you to learn how to roll.  Hopefully these videos will get you interested and will inspire you to go on youtube and watch the pros at work!  So check out these videos (these are without paddles - but you will get the point) - one of them is of me failing, while the other one is a success.  My recommendation to you is to grab a friend, grab some boats, bring a camera (its good to see how you mess up / its pretty funny) and jump in the water.

    <title>A Spartan Sprint Recap: When 5 Miles Takes 2 Hours</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Pennsylvania Spartan Sprint—July 14, 2012</em>

As I walked in, I saw participants heading home, walking tenderly and covered in mud. The race director said this was the hardest, longest race in their “sprint” category. I was also literally facing a ski mountain. I began to feel I had underestimated this race. Five miles is nothing to a half-marathoner, right? Quick, easy, painless? Wrong.

The race started with a run straight up the mountain, which eventually got so steep running was just inefficient. The first few obstacles were okay, walls and rope climbs; then we had to carry a bucket of gravel up and down a hill—that was almost impossible for me. I made it, but slowly. There were a few obstacles I simply could not do due to lack of arm strength or (truly) because I was too short. I quickly learned that in Spartan races, if you can’t complete the obstacle, you have to drop and do 30 burpees (I did 90 total—3 sets). (For a list of all the obstacles, check out the website—spartanrace.com). There was a lot of carrying heavy things up and down hills, crawling under barbed wire, scaling walls, and water obstacles. And lots and lots of mud.

But through it all, I found myself running when I could and just pushing on with a very raw sense of focus and determination.

A really pleasant surprise for me was the camaraderie that was felt along every aspect of the race. If you passed someone, they shouted a “Good job!” or “Good luck!” to you, and you responded with the same encouragement. I wouldn’t have gotten through some of the obstacles without the help of others. I thank the (cute) guys who gave me a lift over some of the walls that were almost twice my height, the girl who held down the rope wall as I scaled it, and one of the ladies who gave me a tip for one of the obstacles. Grateful and inspired by their help, I tried to return the same tips and aid to other runners.The race ended with an incredibly satisfying leap over fire, a t-shirt, medal, showers, and a banana. All runners were chip-timed and results were posted up within minutes. I couldn't believe the clock; five miles of obstacles and mountainous terrain took me 2 hours. But I still placed first in my age group and 366 overall. Woah.

If I had one criticism of the race, it would be that on some of the downhill and uphill parts of the trail, the terrain truly was a little treacherous, with loose gravel and rocks, or very slippery grass. It worried me that the course posed such a risk for a twisted ankle, but I guess that’s why they have you sign the waiver clearly stating that you may die.

Overall, the Spartan Race was a pleasure to run, as masochistic as it may be. The atmosphere was lively, there was a real “Spartan warrior” spirit among the racers, and the course and obstacles were cool as hell. The pain was worth it. I am a Spartan.]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[And just so you get an even better idea, I’ll tell you a little bit about <strong>what I bought</strong>!

<strong><a href="http://www.rei.com/product/819454/black-diamond-primrose-sa-climbing-harness-womens">Harness</a>: </strong>This was a harness I had borrowed from a friend this winter.It is a simple design with easy to adjust straps. I chose it because it has hard gear loops that can hold both rock and ice gear well and it has lots of them in both the front and back of the harness. As for sizing, I bought it slightly bigger than I would normally fit so that even though there is a little extra room during the warmer seasons, in the winter, snow pants will fit more easily. This is something you should consider if you think youll be doing ice climbing in addition to rock.
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_829"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/8c8dd854-705d-424b-9cff-cea70cacd670.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/8c8dd854-705d-424b-9cff-cea70cacd670-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Black Diamond Primrose Women's Harness $55 (full price)</dd></dl></div>
<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/830995/evolv-defy-lace-rock-shoes">Shoes:</a>  I bought this pair of shoes for comfort. Since I am only a beginner climber, stiffness wasnt a big factor for me. I wanted something I could bear to stand in for 10 mins so I wouldnt have to take my shoes off too often while belaying between pitches( on multi-pitch climbs). I chose laces because I like having more ability to adjust tightness in different parts of the shoe since I have wide feet but velcro would be faster getting in and out so that is up to your personal preference. This specific pair are not especially sticky so if you plan on doing a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_climbing">slab climbing</a>, I would consider finding a stickier shoe. However, it is great for everything else so far. The final factor I considered ( only because I had tried another friend’s shoe and made this discovery) is the thickness of the toe. This becomes important when crack climbing. Personally, I wanted a stiff but slimmer (slimmer top to bottom, not side to side) toe because other shoes I had tried had trouble jamming into cracks with the thicker toe-ed shoe.
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_830"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Evolv-Defy-Lace-Climbing-Shoe.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Evolv-Defy-Lace-Climbing-Shoe-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Evolv-Defy-Lace-Climbing-Shoe $80 (full price)</dd></dl></div>
<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/830890/petzl-elia-climbing-helmet-womens">Helmet:</a>  This choice was pretty easy since there are only a few helmet options out there. I chose to go with the Elia because of its pony tail hole but unless the helmet happens to be the same price or not more expensive than the other helmet options, I would go with the standard option since the pony tail hole isnt even that much higher than you would have it in the normal helmet. This of course something you only need to consider as a girl...
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_831"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/31.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/31-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Petzl Elia Women's Helmet $65 (full price)</dd></dl></div>
<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/809737/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device">ATC:</a>  This ATC is slightly lighter weight because, as you’ll notice, there is a hole in the center. This isnt super important but may be nice as you get further into the sport and are concerned about how much weight you are carrying.
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_832"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/440.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/440-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Black Diamond ATC Belay Device ($29 full price)</dd></dl></div>
<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/722353/black-diamond-rocklock-screwgate-carabiner">Locking Carabiner:</a> You'll need this to lock in the ATC and rope.
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_833"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2204%20-%20Black%20Diamond%20Rocklock%20Screwgate%20Aluminum%20Carabiner.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2204%20-%20Black%20Diamond%20Rocklock%20Screwgate%20Aluminum%20Carabiner-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Black Diamond Rocklock Screwgate Carabiner $10(full price)</dd></dl></div>
<a href="http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/chalk/chalk-bag-with-zippered-pocket">Chalk bag:</a>Get a cheap one. There isnt anything special about these. My only criteria was matching!
<div style="text-align: center;"><dl id="attachment_834"><dt><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bd%20chalk%20bagMain.jpeg"><img src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bd%20chalk%20bagMain-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></dt><dd>Black Diamond Chalk Bag $22 (full price)</dd></dl></div>
These are the basics. As you will soon discover, the rabbit hole goes much deeper with all this gear but here is a good place to start. Happy climbing!]]></content:encoded>

    <title>Baby&#039;s First Multi Pitch Climb</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>If you’re new to climbing in general or just new to climbing outside, one way to really get the blood pumping is multi-pitch climbing. Unlike top-roping (where a rope runs from the belayer, through an anchor system at the top of the route and back down to the climber on the other end of the rope), multi-pitch climbing involves a “lead” climber climbing, placing “protection”( gear--namely cams, nuts, or ice screws) in the rock or ice along the way for protection from falling, and then building their own anchor system at the top of the “pitch”, from which they may then belay the next climber up to their stopping point.</div>
The “pitch” length can be determined a few ways: a) by the length of the rope b) if there is a good stopping point--a well protected ledge making a good belay station or fixed bolts making easy anchor points. c) if the leader has run out of protective gear to place along the route. Multi-pitch climbing allows you to ascend climbing routes that are hundreds, even thousands of feet high. However, with this added adventure, there come many more risks so it is important to know a little bit about what to expect and how to prepare for a multi-pitch climb. While I won’t get into the specifics of rope handling and gear setting/cleaning here since it can be complicated and unique to the people with whom you decide to climb, I will give some general impressions and lessons from my first experience.

My first multi-pitch rock climb was at Cathedral Ledge in North Conway, NH. This is a classic east coast climbing spot with 400ft of granite projecting up out of the Mount Washington Valley. After only climbing in the gym, the sheer amount of air below me was quite the shock. If you are someone who is affected by heights, staying relaxed and focused will likely be the biggest challenge mentally. On the flip side, this very fear is also the biggest rush!

Here is what I brought with me:
-Harness
-Helmet
-Climbing Shoes
-Normal shoes (for the descent by foot afterwards- on multi-pitch climbs, you generally “ top out” meaning you don’t repel down but instead reach the top of the cliff and hike down to the base)

-ATC and extra locking carabiners

-Chalk Bag
<p dir="ltr">-Energy bars</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Water</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Water resistant/proof shell ( it often gets cold or weather changes so its good to have this extra layer.)</p>
What I borrowed/used that was not mine:
-sling/webbing to hook into anchor
-ropes
-alpine draws
-gear cleaner

Note: This climb was done in the spring on a relatively warm day so if it were colder, your clothing choices would obviously be different.

I put the water, food, shell, and descent shoes in a small light back pack. Sunscreen before climbing! Chances are youll be very exposed to the sun.

Just looking at this list gives you an idea of some of the characteristics of multi-pitch climbing. The days can be long and the challenges facing climbers are slightly different. While you may climb lower rated climbs than your ability level, the frequency and speed at which you will be climbing will serve as ample challenge. Furthermore, you’ll be happy to have the extras like food to keep your energy levels up and your mind sharp because multi-pitch climbing requires much more interaction with your gear, whether you are a leader or a follower. The leader must place gear, set anchors, and belay the followers. The follower has to <a href="http://www.climbingtechniques.org/lead-belaying.html">lead belay</a> the leader, clean(take out) the gear placed by the leader, and undo the anchor before beginning to climb again. This said, a few warm up climbs on smaller routes can be extremely helpful not only to get your muscles warmed up but also to get in the zone mentally.

All in all, even though I havent done much climbing, I would say multi-pitch is my favorite so far. While you may not always be doing the most challenging climbs or the most acrobatic moves, you’re going somewhere. Youre going up towards a peak, towards a great view, towards the sky. Not to mention, the great rush you get when you get when you look down not to gym mats 30 ft below but to rocks and forest hundreds of feet below.

Rock on, (ha! get it?)

    <title>Ice Climbing for under $1000</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last post I talked about having the opportunity to try out some awesome gear at last year's Ouray Ice Fest. The Women's La Sportiva Nepal EVO's that I climbed in were magic, and they should be considering that they retail normally for around $480. The Ice tools brand new cost around $300...each, and the crampons hang out around $150. We're talking more than $1000 worth of gear that you get to use one season a year. One day when I'm making the big bucks and climbing multiple times a week, these will be a good investment, similar to how I needed a good bike since I use it almost every day. But as a Junior in Boston, I'm ice climbing only 3-4 times a year if I'm lucky, making these shiny, sharp toys way out of my price range.

Unfortunately, ice climbing is one of those sports that is impossible without the proper gear, for safety as well as just

plain technical reasons (although I've heard of people using wool gloves to shimmy-up low angle ice. Apparently the wool freezes to the ice and sort of sticks to it...not recommended.)

My first winter hike and ice climbing experiences were jammed into one weekend during my first February in the Northeast. I borrowed a pair of Scarpa Inverno Mountaineering boots from Tufts Mountain Club. They were a solid pair of boots, a little worn, and about a size and a half too big for me. Regardless, I was just excited to get outside in the cold and so I put on three pairs of wool socks, and took off on my first winter over night. The hike up wasn't bad, but the hike down the next day took a serious tole on my shins and toes. My big toes on both of my feet were numb with pain by the time we made it down, but I refused to take off my boots until I had at least tried ice climbing. I did two climbs, and then finally took my boots off. Four of my toenails were black, and I could barely walk for the next week. I remember brushing my toe up against a flip-flop, and instantly crying in pain.

Note the bike helmet..."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17168_522379296018_47701687_30875378_8259631_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-141" title="17168_522379296018_47701687_30875378_8259631_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17168_522379296018_47701687_30875378_8259631_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

It took a few weeks for the pain to recede, and then about 6 months for them to finally fall off and start growing back. Real gross. Therefore, for the next winter, I kept my eyes peeled for a pair of mountaineering boots that would fit me. I set my price limit at $100 and started checking out craigslist every so often. I figured that having a pair of boots would be a good call, since they have multiple uses: winter hiking as well as ice climbing. Crampons and ice tools I could potentially borrow when needed, and usually the people I go with have an extra set.

That winter I got really lucky when I borrowed a friend's mountaineering boots for a day of climbing. They are white, hard plastic, purple-laced, doubled booted beasts from at least the early 90's. The tops are a little beat up but the bottoms looked as if they had never been worn. She had bought them off of craigslist but they were half a size too big. I wore them for the day, and to my delight, they fit me perfectly. It took me a year, but this past December, I finally convinced her that these boots would have a loving home if she sold them to me. The best part? It only costed me $50. I don't care at all that they are not the lightest or warmest or newest model, what I care about is the fact that they fit me, allow me to ice climb and hike in the winter safely, and will allow me to keep all of my toenails. As far as crampons and ice tools? I'm still keeping an eye out for a good deal. Hit me up if you're selling any dirt cheap.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's times like these when I thank my lucky stars for still being in college. When else would I have the opportunity to hear, meet, and hang out with the BEST ICE CLIMBER<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> IN THE WORLD</strong></span>?!?!

Thanks to the Tufts Mountain Club and <a href="http://viceaxe.com/vice/Home/">V.I.C.E</a> (Vertical Ice Climbing Enthusiasts), Will Gadd will be speaking at the Cabot Auditorium at Tufts University (170 Packard Avenue, Medford, MA 02155) next Thursday, February 2nd at 8pm. It costs $10 at the door but is FREE with a Tufts ID.

Here are some highlights for the epic-ness that is this unbelievable man:

-Establishing the hardest mixed ice climbing lines in the world.

-Setting the world distance record for paragliding. Twice. 423 km (263 miles) the second time.

-Kayaking down dozens of first ascents across North America.

-Winning the Canadian National Sport-Climbing Championships. Four times.

-Winning three gold medals at the X Games. And the Ice Climbing World Cup.

-Winning the US and Canadian Paragliding Nationals.

-Flying my paraglider over the Grand Canyon.

-Climbing icebergs off the coast of Labrador with Ben Firth

&nbsp;

I remember my first iceberg...

See you next Thursday!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[As Spring semester starts moving into full gear, my familiar friends stress and anxiety have made their unwelcome way back into my day to day life. As if being a full time student wasn't enough, everyone around me is either talking about applying for internships, or where they are going to work when they graduate. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I tend to prioritize spending all of my free time during the week and weekends hiking or climbing. Many, including myself, occasionally think that there are no "resumé" building skills to be gained in the outdoors, but I am here to argue otherwise.

I was once told by a wise mentor that if I can lead a group safely through the wilderness, I can sure as hell lead them in a board room. Whether or not this applies directly, you cannot discredit the leadership skills that you learn in the outdoors, whether as a camp counselor, or weekend trip leader. Start by joining your school's outdoor or mountain club and look for leadership opportunities within the club. Keep your eyes peeled for summer jobs at summer camps or as a summer caretaker. Guaranteed you'll have a fun and exciting summer outside, while also learning valuable skills.

Another thing to keep in mind is that being able to and <em>enjoying </em>getting and staying dirty is, believe it or not, a rarity. Not everyone is happy peeing outside and carrying around their own toilet paper. And few can successfully survive off of freeze dried food and protein bars. These were all skills that I found came in hand this past winter break when I was part of a health service brigade to Guatemala with <a href="http://www.timmyglobalhealth.org/">Timmy Global Health.</a> The details of the trip are perhaps better left to a separate post, but many NGOs, national and international service organizations value somebody who is not afraid to get down dirty, someone who doesn't particularly need a shower more than once a week. Along with looking fantastic on your resumé, these types of jobs and volunteer opportunities, whether they are during your breaks or after you graduate, will give you the opportunity to make the world we live in a little bit better of a place.

Organizations such as <a href="http://www.overlandsummers.com/">Overland</a>, <a href="http://goputney.com/">Putney Student Travel</a>, and <a href="http://theroadlesstraveled.com/">The Road Less Traveled </a>offer an opportunity to combine adventure with service. What programs have you been on that would fall under this category?

    <title>Tips on Cold Weather Running</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're anything like me, you despise gyms. They have only a couple of real uses in my book: a place to swim in the winter,  a pull up bar, and the occasional good looking person. Although running on a treadmill has its benefits (easier on the shins, a tendency to run faster) there is something to be said for getting out in the crisp winter air and dodging patches of ice on your run.

Here's some tips to keep you warm and fast! The basic idea is that when you're running in the cold, you want to stay <strong>warm </strong>and <strong>dry</strong> using, if possible, only 2 or 3 layers.

[caption id="attachment_179" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Tufts Marathon Team in 10 degree weather. Exercise gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-12.16.47-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-179" title="Screen shot 2012-02-01 at 12.16.47 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-12.16.47-PM-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Avoid wearing cotton</strong>. Cotton is very absorbent and stays wetter, longer, and is heavier when wet, as compared to synthetic fabrics. Wearing wet cotton is more cumbersome and less comfortable than wearing wet/damp synthetics. You'll notice the difference especially with socks and t-shirts. You don't need fancy, expensive name brands to get the job done. Check out Target, Marshalls, etc for synthetic clothes.

<strong>Layers: </strong>The innermost layer (shirt &amp; pants next to your skin)should be a synthetic long underwear-type layer that wicks moisture away from your skin. This is a relatively thin layer. The outermost layer (exposed to the elements) should be a breathable wind barrier. A light micro fleece is what I use, but what you're really going to want is wind protection. Even a super thin wind or waterproof jacket (like your rain jacket) will work beautifully. Things too look for if you need to go and buy a wind layer: a hood, and pit zips (armpit zips) are clutch (read: awesome) for heat control. If it's super cold out, a light fleece might be best between those layers.

<strong>Hats and gloves:</strong> Preferecnes vary of course, but a light synthtic hat or synthetic head band that covers your ears are essential. Your ears will get cold. I'm too hot will a full hat on and so a fleece head band work perfectly. A thin pair of gloves should work just fine, but if your hand get cold easier, mittens will keep your hands warmer than gloves.

Note: running in cold weather without a shirt is not recommended."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-12.14.11-PM1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-180" title="Screen shot 2012-02-01 at 12.14.11 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-12.14.11-PM1-300x198.png" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a>[/caption]

    <title>The Benefits of Yoga as a Student</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've found myself in many conversations about yoga in the past month or so. Last semester I started attending classes once or twice a week that were taught by students at Tufts through Tufts Student Resources (TSR). I had done yoga sporadically over the years, mostly to accompany my mom, but I had never before attended so consistently. After about a year of doing yoga 2-4 times a week, I have become a hardcore believer in the physical and emotional benefits of the practice. Here are some reasons why I believe doing yoga even just once a week is crucial to your success as a college outdoorsman:

[caption id="attachment_193" align="alignright" width="179" caption="AcroYoga at the Tufts Loj during VICEfest"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo-42.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-193" title="photo (4)" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo-42-179x300.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

1) <strong>Strength, Flexibility, Abs:</strong> Replacing one day of your gym routine with an hour of yoga may be just what you need to catapult you to the next level. There are three aspects to athleticism: Strength, endurance, and flexibility, and yoga can help you with all three. The flexibility you gain will help you prevent injuries during your weekend adventures, in addition to helping you solve that bouldering problem you've been working on. Even after not climbing for 3 months, I was able to climb as hard as ever thanks to these weekly practices. The upper and lower body work outs, in addition to all the holds and twists that work your core, will test your athletic ability, as well as tone your entire body.

2) <strong>Stress reduction: </strong>In our crazy fast life of working hard during the week, and playing hard on the weekends, stress can become a daily occurrence. Taking an hour to clear your mind and work your body can help not only with stress reduction, but with your general emotional wellness, enhancement of the immune system, and improved balance and postural alignment. This can be key, especially since as students, we sit in chairs all day long and rarely take a real break. I found myself looking forward to the one hour a week when I didn't have to think about anything. I always left the practice refreshed and ready to conquer.

[caption id="attachment_189" align="alignright" width="199" caption="Kate doing a casual headstand before getting on the ice."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/426022_2720280409631_1335660133_32503021_864708655_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" title="426022_2720280409631_1335660133_32503021_864708655_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/426022_2720280409631_1335660133_32503021_864708655_n-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

3) <strong>Injury Prevention and Therapy: </strong>Needless to say, the harder you play, the more likely you are to get injured. I, personally, struggle from ankles weaker than paper and a high impact neck injury. More than a few times I've been stopped from hiking, climbing, and even running from these irritating facts of life. Even after months, heck, years of physical therapy, I would still roll my ankle and get headaches. But after about 6 months of yoga, my ankles started to strengthen (hello balancing postures) and my neck and back muscles became stronger and leaner, almost completely eliminating my daily headaches. There are of course dangers to plunging into a hardcore yoga routine, and like anything else, needs to be approached cautiously and slowly. There was recently an article in the NY Times titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/magazine/how-yoga-can-wreck-your-body.html?pagewanted=all">"How Yoga Can Wreck Your Body",</a> which may get you thinking about the potential risks of doing yoga. But, hey, there's risk in ice climbing too, you just have to learn how to make it safe for yourself, and then maybe you'll experience the benefits that I have! Take a look at <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/Stretching-It.html?page=all">Outside Magazine's response</a> for a different perspective. All I can say, is that I've never been stronger or felt better.

<em>Check out your university's PE department to see if you can even take yoga for credit (I am this semester!) or keep an eye on sites like <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu36818447">Groupon</a> or <a href="http://www.livingsocial.com/">LivingSocial</a>. They're always giving away great deals on yoga classes. </em>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I used to think that yoga was for people who couldn't do real sports.  After being exposed to yoga through P90X in my junior year of college I became a firm believer in its benefits.  I still wouldn't advocate for exclusively practicing yoga as your main athletic event but rather use it as a supplement to your strength, flexibility, and power training for other sports.  As an athlete, how much you can bench press is pretty trivial(aside from maybe power lifting).  Yoga helps build your core and gives you control over your body, very important for the sports I grew up playing (hockey, baseball, xc, rock climbing, etc).  I seem to sweat more during a 60 minute yoga session than I do running 13 miles. If you've never done yoga, go try it out and I guarantee you'll be humbled.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>OR VersaLiner™ Glove - Gear Review</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know a lot about gloves. I have probably spent over half my lifetime in gloves: riding horses, stacking hay, pulling fences, skiing, biking, camping and prepping pizzas. I know that good gloves have to balance protection/warmth with dexterity and retained sensation. I also know that this fall, I found my favorite pair of gloves to date: The Outdoor Research (OR) VersaLiners. As the name implies, they are versatile. Here is a brief list of things you can do in them:<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/OR-Versaliner1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-203" title="OR-Versaliner1" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/OR-Versaliner1-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="300" /></a>

-Run (in temps down to 18 degrees with or without precipitation)

-Cycle (in temps down to 25 degrees (wind-chill not included) with or without precipitation)

-Use your iPhone

-Open latches on gates

-Light a Whisperlight

-Tie knots

-Win a snowball fight

-Carry a small fortune in the back-of-hand pocket

-Ice climb

-Break a colt to ride

-Open things in wrappers (Clif Bars, Hand Warmers, Condoms etc.)

-Wear them under gloves or mittens (even mittens with finger liners)

Sick, right?

Over the years, I have become a bigger and bigger fan of OR as a company. They make products that work, fit well, look good and hold up to substantial abuse. Their products are always simple and well designed, a cut above minimalist and several steps below the rocket ships that Mountain Hardwear usually produces. And these gloves are no exception.

<strong>Specs: </strong>

-100-weight Radiant Fleece™ liner fabric; smooth face, brushed back

-Waterproof/breathable, 2.5 layer 40D Pertex® Shield DS stretch ripstop fabric

-Zippered pocket on back of hand doubles as shell storage and heat pack pocket

-Silicone prints on liner fingertips and palm provide solid grip and keeps liner in place

under a shell

-Reflective logo on shell

<strong>OR says: </strong>

<em>            “When the weather turns suddenly uncooperative, the VersaLiner™ reverse modular gloves offer breathable insulation and waterproof protection for high-energy adventures. With a 100-weight Radiant Fleece™ insulating liner, and a removable waterproof and breathable Pertex® Shield DS stretch ripstop fabric shell, the VersaLiner™ protects hands from the weather while also transporting perspiration away from the skin. The zippered back-of-hand pocket - for shell storage - doubles as a heat pack pocket for when conditions turn unexpectedly icy.”</em>

[caption id="attachment_204" align="alignright" width="225" caption="You can also bear hug trail signs in these gloves."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/403002_2545831685269_1238070151_32808558_241257268_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-204" title="403002_2545831685269_1238070151_32808558_241257268_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/403002_2545831685269_1238070151_32808558_241257268_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

If you spend any amount of time outside in cold temps, buy them. I have used these gloves for everything from running a workout to ice climbing (in mild weather) to using a digital camera. They not only keep you warm, but if you pull the shells out of the handy-dandy back-of-hand pockets, they will keep you dry. And I was able wear them under a pair of mittens that had finger liners and still maintain enough dexterity to belay. Since this winter has been more of a spring, I have yet to test them under my mittens in extreme cold, but the combo feels like it would hold up. The back-of-hand pockets not only provide a home for the off duty shells, but credit cards, car keys, hand warmers and other odd and ends. The simple design makes them elegant enough to pair with your fur lined boots and Little Black Dress for those après ski activties. My favorite feature is the length of the cuff; I have yet to combine these with a shirt where I had a gap between glove and shirt. The palms and fingers have textured pimples that allow touch screen use and provide grip when pouring hot beverages.

I bought them on sale form rei.com for $25.99, but they usually run $45. That being said, knowing what I know now, I would still buy them. They are only available men’s sizes, so ladies order down. I bought mediums and usually wear an 8.5 (for those of you who know glove sizes) and am quite happy with the fit, although I have big hands.

Skip your morning latte for 10 days, put in 4.5 extra hours at your job or host a bake sale and then get you and your warm hands outside from some winter adventures!

<strong>With love and warmth from your #1 gear hound,</strong>

Mad Dawg

    <title>A Valentine&#039;s Day Disaster in the White Mountains</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[A year ago today I had planned a perfectly non-corny romantic weekend for my boyfriend Mike and I. Instead of our usual routine of going up to New Hampshire, doing something ridiculously exhausting all day, drinking a few beers and then passing out at night, I thought we would spend the weekend at the Tufts Loj getting some well deserved R+R. I bought the ingredients to make Beer Can Chicken for dinner with homemade sweet potato fries, and Nutella-raspberry crepes for dessert. We didn’t need to bring up all of our gear because all we were going to do was go on a little cross country ski and then hang out and enjoy being at the Loj.<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-14-at-12.18.05-PM1.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-211" title="Screen shot 2012-02-14 at 12.18.05 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-14-at-12.18.05-PM1.png" alt="" width="447" height="337" /></a>

But then things changed. Sometime around the middle of the afternoon, the Loj caretakers were informed that my friend from the mountain club was lost with his brother somewhere near Mt. Kinsman and Mt. Cannon. The only other people at the Loj that weekend were a group of freshman, which meant that Michael and I were the most experienced people there, and so we volunteered to go out as first responders since the local search and rescue people were a couple of hours out.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here’s what we knew:</span>
<ul>
  <li>Our friend had lost his snowshoes, as well as both of his low top hiking boots. He only had cotton socks. His brother also lost his snowshoes. Apparently they got buried if 4-5 feet of snow when they got lost off of the trail. Our friend lost his boots by stepping into a stream which apparently sucked off his shoes and he couldn’t recuperate them.</li>
  <li>They had forgotten to bring food, and didn’t have enough water.</li>
  <li>They had not told anyone where they would be, and had mentioned that they might spend the night out. We were<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/warning_sign.jpeg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-212" title="warning_sign" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/warning_sign.jpeg" alt="" width="395" height="279" /></a> lucky that they were able to reach us, or else we would not have worried about them until the next day.</li>
  <li>They had called someone else when they first were lost, but the Loj caretakers weren’t notified until a few hours after that first call.</li>
  <li>We couldn’t reach them anymore since either their phone had died or they had lost service.</li>
  <li>As of the last call, they were disoriented, lost and tired, most likely in early stages of hypothermia.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A number of things went wrong on the way to the trail head:</span>
<ul>
  <li>I did not have the proper clothing or gear to go out into the White Mountains, but I decided that I would anyways.</li>
  <li>Our friend and his brother had not filled out a trips form and so we only had a rough idea where they might be; we weren’t even really sure what trails they took.</li>
  <li> We lost cell service on the drive up and so could not communicate with the caretaker who was the point of contact.</li>
</ul>
Luck would have it that we ran into the fish and game police in one parking lot, and they were able to set us up with proper first aid kits, walky-talkies, very powerful headlamps, and some warm clothing if we found the boys. In addition, Mike and I had brought a very warm sleeping bag and a bottle of hot water to warm our friend up if he was hypothermic, as well as some food. We made it over to the proper parking lot where we assumed they had started, although their car wasn’t there. I have never been so nervous in my life, knowing that I was unprepared, the temperature was dropping, and the sun was about to go down. What would we even do if we found them? By the time we ready to go, the full search and rescue crew had arrived, and so we were there to support their efforts and cover more ground.

Just as we were about to split up and head out, I miraculously received a text message (we were in a no-service zone) that our friend had made it out a few minutes before us and they were on the way to the hospital.

I have to give mad props to the caretaker that weekend, who, thanks to his EMT training, did an amazing job as the point person and making sure that everything was organized and executed in a calm and efficient manner. We were very lucky that he was up there that weekend.

This episode will haunt me for a very long time. It was a classic example of a bunch of little things going wrong, and then eventually turning into a disaster, and putting many people’s lives at risk. Thankfully there was a very powerful response from the Tufts Mountain Club to put procedures in order to prevent a situation like this happening ever again.

I believe that winter activities can be very fun, but they can also be very dangerous and demand a healthy amount of respect. <a href="http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/surviving.php">The White Mountains are particularly dangerous since they are so accessible from highways and cities like Boston that many people don’t take them that seriously.</a> However, they have some of the worst weather in the country, which is a deadly combination with naivety. Our friend was not an inexperienced outdoorsman; he had lots of summer and rock climbing experience, but they went out in February thinking it was just like August. There are somethings you can get away with in the summer that winter will be relentless about.]]></content:encoded>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well documented story Sarah.  In this same vein of being prepared and having the requisite humility for winters in the white mountains here are a few books:

"Not Without Peril: 150 Years of Misadventure on the Presidential Range"
http://www.amazon.com/Not-Without-Peril-Tenth-Anniversary/dp/1934028320/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329329434&amp;sr=8-2

"Accidents in North American Mountaineering" The American Alpine Club publishes a book every year (100-ish pages each) cataloging in 2-3 pages each climbing accident that has happened in North America for that year.  They give you the short of what happened, why it may have happened, and what could have been done to avoid it.  There are over 50 years of these books in print and you can get them used for around $1.
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_20?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=accidents+in+north+american+mountaineering&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=accidents+in+north+a%2Cstripbooks%2C219

Also, the Mountaineering Bible "Freedom of the Hills" is a resource that every outdoor adventurer should have and consult on a frequent basis. Again, you can get these super cheap used on amazon (less than $10).

How did you make the call to set out despite feeling underprepared? Were you counting on your own judgement of when to turn back to keep yourselves from getting in to your own bad spot?

I'm also mystified by the idea of boots and snowshoes being instantly whisked away in a stream. A stark reminder of respect for winter water hazards.]]></wp:comment_content>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The snowshoe situation was indeed mystifying.  Apparently when they had gotten off the trail they encountered 5 foot deep snow.  Their MSR snowshoes didn't keep them buoyant and as a result they got waist deep in snow more than a few times.  The weight of the snow on top of the snowshoes pulled them off as they tried to get their legs unstuck from the powder.  For whatever reason neither person was able to recover their snowshoes (they eventually paid back the TMC for lost property).

For the lost shoes, he had stepped through the snow into a stream.  The water, snow, and slush sucked his boot off, much like stepping in the mud.  This happened to both shoes and neither was recovered.  So he walked out without his shoes on, in cotton socks.  After several hours of this he and his brother managed to get to the highway and drive themselves to the hospital.  Luckily, he ended up with severe frostbite on both feet and both hands, no digits were lost, spent time on pain killers and two weeks at home away from school recovering.

As for the preparedness for Sarah and I.  We didn't have the appropriate gear either; summer hiking boots and non-water proof pants because we planned on a nice quiet weekend at the Tufts Loj.  We decided to help for a few reasons.

1.) From his brother's last call to the Tufts Loj we knew they were between two points, on one of two trails only a few miles from the highway.  At that point they were sitting down and resting and the one without his shoes was hypothermic, although not unresponsive, his brother didn't know what this meant.

2.) The rescue that was initiated came from North Conway, at least a 1 hour drive not counting prep time, so 2 hours was reasonable just to get to the trail head, let alone begin searching.

3.) Sarah and I were knowledgeable about the two trails, having hiked them several times both together and separately.  Knowing it was only a few miles to where the two trails intersected, we felt confident that we could walk to the intersection and back without harm.

4.)  When we showed up to the trail head, a Fish and Game warden was there with two rescuers from Canon Mountain right next door (luckily they were just getting off duty and volunteered to help considering the crew from North Conway was still hours away).  We planned to split up, Sarah and I up one trail, the rescuers up the other, meet in the middle and then hike back down.

5.)  We had a dry set of clothes/socks, a spare set of boots, a -40F darkstar sleeping bag, head lamps, some food, a warm thermos of water, first aid kit, space blanket, a radio to communicate with the other rescuers, etc.

All that aside we weren't well prepared either, it was dark, started to snow, and was around 15F and getting colder.  Everyone's lives were in danger (even though we and the rescuers volunteered) because a few simple things were overlooked as mentioned in Sarah's post above.  Luckily the boys made it out by themselves and to the hospital before someone died.  Sarah and I had more than a few frank conversations about the likelihood of us finding him dead, or not finding him at all.  I think about this situation every time I go out into a winter adventure.  It's an unpleasant reminder of how a little bit of preparedness can go along way, but it's a reminder none the less.

Also we got a good lesson on not relying on your cell phone for help.  We had spotty service and more often than not no service at all, so contact with the Tufts Loj was minimal if not non-existent.]]></wp:comment_content>

I think one of the more important lessons that came from the episode is the response that the Tufts Mountain Club had.

Sasha DiGuilian and I have a lot in common. We're both fit females that can't yet legally drink. We both like to exercise in pink sports bras, and we're both really competitve. Oh, except she's one of the best female climbers in the world right now. In case you were hiding under a rock last fall, this 18 year old blond girl made us all look really bad. On October 15th 2011, adidas team athlete, Sasha DiGiulian became the first American women to climb the grade 9a (5.14d) with her historic ascent of "Pure Imagination" in Kentucky's Red River Gorge. She's only the third woman <em>ever</em> to climb that grade. I realize that although this may be ancient history by now, I've found myself thinking about her a lot, and how she breaks all of the rules and excuses I've made for myself over the past couple of years.

My first response after hearing about this accomplishment was jealousy. She was cute, blond, didn't take life too seriously, and climbed like a baller. But jealousy quickly turned to respect and self-reflection. I consider myself a jack of all trades. I've tried a lot of things, and am decent at most of them, but really good at none of them. I enjoy this part of myself. It allows me to have a wide range of friends, and to be able to play hard at whatever people around me choose to do. But I've never been the <em>best. </em>

I've been thinking about whether or not I should have devoted my life (or at least my college life) to one thing. Should I have learned to climb and then given it all I had? I might have been able to create a name for myself, maybe even called myself a good climber.

[caption id="attachment_266" align="alignright" width="199" caption="PC: http://www.sasha-digiulian.com/"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/301999_288056397890874_204164662946715_1124908_850130248_n.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-266" title="301999_288056397890874_204164662946715_1124908_850130248_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/301999_288056397890874_204164662946715_1124908_850130248_n-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

I look at Sasha and I think of the amazing things that someone can accomplish if they devote their life to it. Before I saw the video of her doing this climb, I used to think that I didn't have the "body type" to be a climber, whatever that meant. I'm not very tall, my strength to weight ratio isn't the best, I'm not old enough to have enough experience. All of these excuses were thrown out the window when I learned that Sasha is only 5'2" and was 18 years old when she climbed "Pure Imagination".

So what does this mean to me? Maybe if I had started climbing at age 4, and maybe if my parents were climbers and had pushed me through my teenage years to continue climbing, maybe that could have been me. Maybe. But now that my dream of being the first American woman to climb a 5.14d is crushed, I can focus on more attainable goals. Being a student puts a damper on the amount of time I can truly dedicate to any outdoor endeavor, but Sasha gives me hope for the future. For now, I have my sights set on the half snowshoe marathon I'm running the weekend after next. That 5.15 I've been eyeing may just have to wait.

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: Hypothermia Symptoms</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is the first of the weekly "Freedom of the Hills Friday". I bought a deck of Freedom of the Hills

[caption id="attachment_271" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Best $5 I ever spent."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/prd5add3f85-95d7-4342-82b4-885b801f2735.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-271" title="prd5add3f85-95d7-4342-82b4-885b801f2735" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/prd5add3f85-95d7-4342-82b4-885b801f2735-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>[/caption]

Playing cards, and so every Friday I'll pick a random card, and write about the lesson that is on that card. This week's card was a 7 of hearts on Hypothermia Symptoms:

<strong>Hypothermia: </strong>Hypothermia results when the body's core temperature drops to 95° F (35°C) or lower. Risk factors include dehydration and prolonged exposure to wet clothing and wind. Prolonged exposure to wet, windy conditions is more likely than a sudden cold snap to lead to hypothermia.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mild Hypothermia Symptoms (</strong>Body temp of 90-95°F/32-25°C)<strong>: </strong>Symptoms include intense shivering, fumbling hand movements, stumbling, dulling of mental functions, uncooperative behavior (I know this as the “Umbles”: stumbles, mumbles, grumbles, fumbles). This stage is not seriously dangerous, but can progress quickly to severe hypothermia which is extremely dangerous. Hypothermia can be instigated even in 50°F weather if the victim is wet or if there is wind. Make sure to have a change of dry clothes and a rain jacket at all times.

[caption id="attachment_273" align="alignright" width="225" caption="This is a good way to keep warm. Just make sure you put your puffy jacket on when you&#39;re done!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/16955_592116366908_1705074_35116795_4824561_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-273" title="16955_592116366908_1705074_35116795_4824561_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/16955_592116366908_1705074_35116795_4824561_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>What to do in the case of mild Hypothermia:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Eat and drink. Food=calories. Calories=heat.</li>
  <li>Remove and replace all wet and/or cotton clothing, remembering that "cotton kills" (since it doesn't keep you warm when wet. Synthetic layers are a must).</li>
  <li>Exercise in short bursts to generate heat. "Feed um and beat um."</li>
  <li>Apply heat (like a warm water bottle) to neck, armpits and groin area.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Severe Hypothermia Symptoms (</strong>Body temp below 90°F/32°C):  Lack of shivering, obvious decline in muscle and nervous system function (muscles are stiff and movements uncoordinated), inability to walk, confused or irrational behavior, stupor or actual unconsciousness, fading pulse and respiration, dilated pupils.

<strong>Treatment: </strong>Someone with severe hypothermia is in a critical situation. Get medical attention immediately; this should be your highest priority. In the mean time, the best thing to do it get protection from the elements and attempt to warm them up on the spot. Put the affected person in a sleeping bag or under a pile of blankets with one or two other people. Body heat can do wonders. Treat person very delicately and do <em>not</em> give them hot fluids to drink.

I've only had mild hypothermia a couple of times, and changing into dry clothes and getting into a sleeping bag with another person usually does the trick. To see how hypothermia can affect your decision making process, <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/a-valentines-day-disaster-in-the-white-mountains/">check out this story of a pair of boys that were lost in the White Mountains in New Hampshire. </a>

Has anyone ever had or seen severe hypothermia? What did you do? Were you trained to know how to treat it?

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I remember one time a friend and I had done a winter overnight on the Kinsmans.  On our way down we stopped by to ice climb for a few hours with friends and then drove back to the Tufts Loj.  She fell asleep on the 15 minute drive back and when she woke up at the Loj she was shivering uncontrollably.  Because she had fallen asleep her body stopped producing as much heat and her pulse rate lowered dramatically, that combined with the damp clothes from climbing was a bad combo.  However, after we put her in some dry clothes and she spent 5 minutes in a zero degree sleeping bag in the Loj she was fine, but it definitely shows how easy it is to slip into hypothermia especially when you're damp and tired.

Also, I like the phrase "Heat em, feed em, and beat em" when it comes to hypothermia symptoms.  Heat them by putting on dry clothes (base layer, jacket, gloves, hat, etc), then Feed them (put down a cliff bar or some trail mix), and then Beat them (make them hike up and down a bit).  Nothing like dry clothes, food, and exercise to warm you up from within.

Being protected from the elements is also key.  Weather in the White Mountains can change rapidly and hypothermia cases happen even in the summer.  I recall a summer prezi-traverse (2011) where it was 60 degrees but with 100% humidity and 40mph winds it was prime time hypothermia conditions if you're not careful.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>Snowshoe Half-Marathon, Pittsfield VT</title>

This weekend was the annual<a href="http://peakraces.com/"> Peak Races </a>Pittsfield snowshoe race in Vermont. Every year for 4 or 5 years Tufts has sent a strong group of undergraduates and alumni to represent and tear it up. Last year, I was in appalling shape, and barely made it through the "fun run" 10k. This year, I was manipulated into signing up for the half marathon.

The way the race works is that each lap up the mountain is about 6.5 miles. At the top and bottom of the mountain is a food and water station and a few people to cheer you on. You can choose to do the Fun Run (1 lap), the Half Marathon (2 Laps), Full Marathon (4 laps),  Ultra-Marathon (100 miles, 15 laps), or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI-HrvBARSY">Death Race.</a>

This year we camped out behind a Bikram yoga studio the night before in winter tents where I got to try out a Nemo -40• sleeping bag that a friend JLo (Jeffrey Longcor) had been testing. It rained freezing rain all night long, and we were preparing to have a miserable day running and hiking in sleet and snow while trying not to get hypothermia.

[caption id="attachment_322" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Pre-race adrenaline. Bright colors make me race faster."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/423349_816629820148_1708220_37984011_1116671016_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-322" title="423349_816629820148_1708220_37984011_1116671016_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/423349_816629820148_1708220_37984011_1116671016_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

Here's what I brought to the race for the Half-Marathon:
<ul>
  <li>For the race: <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/what-to-wear-winter-hiking/">warm base layers (top and bottom),</a> micro fleece, rain jacket and pants, wool socks, hiking boots, snow shoes, gaiters (works to keep your feet marginally drier during the race), gloves, hat, and a couple power bars/Gu.</li>
  <li>For after the race: A whole change of dry clothes (socks, shoes, pants, shirt, underwear), down jacket, beer.</li>
</ul>
Luck was with us, and it ended up being a clear, rain free race day. Our strategy was to run/jog the flats and down hills, and fast hike the uphills. The race was awesome, but the best part was sitting around the bonfire afterwards, waiting for our friends to finish the marathon. We watched the Death Racers do 1,000 burpees, jump in the freezing river, and then do another 1,000 burpees. As Mike B would say, it's definitely a place to feel like a boy among men (or women, whatever).

What is the Death Race you may ask? According their website, the course is "TBA - You can expect barbed wire, mud boggin, wood choppin, tunnels, deep water diving, running, crawling, crying, screaming, and sweating. Doubtful you'll finish but be proud of yourself for trying." Essentially, from an outsider's perspective, they make you do what ever they feel like, while taunting you and doing everything in their power to make you quit.

[caption id="attachment_323" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Champion marathon snowshoers. &quot;The banana suit messes up my layering system.&quot;"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/429322_816632814148_1708220_37984076_138970195_n1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-323" title="429322_816632814148_1708220_37984076_138970195_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/429322_816632814148_1708220_37984076_138970195_n1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

In any case, although I felt pathetic next to the Death Racers and the 80 year old man who ran the 100 miler, I was proud of myself for finishing the Half Marathon. Most of it was probably due to doing the race with my friend Kate who kept me going up on the second lap when my hip-flexers were yelling STOP! I highly recommend doing one of these "alternative" races (snowshoe races, death races, spartan races, tough mudder, etc). It's a great way to spend a weekend, and people will think you're crazy when you tell them what you did.]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Freedom of the Hills Fridays continues today with a little vocabulary lesson in mountain features. These are terms that seasoned mountaineers and climbers throw around, leaving the rest of us feeling like they're speaking a different language. But now, next time you're reading a Jon Krakauer adventure, you can nod in appreciation as he talks about the massive <em>dihedrals</em> and <em>cols</em> that he had to conquer. Heck, next time you're on a date, don't be afraid to mention that large talus slope you scrambled up. Nothing gets a girl going more than talus slopes.

<strong>Arrête: </strong>Sharp crested ridge.

[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Bergschrund"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/33bergschrund.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-344" title="33bergschrund" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/33bergschrund-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Bergschrund: </strong>Giant crevasse at the upper limit of glacier movement, formed where a moving glacier breaks away from an ice cap or snowfield above.

<strong>Chimney: </strong>Crack wide enough to fit a climber's body and narros enough to allow for opposing forse to be applied to both walls.

<strong>Col: </strong>Saddle or pass.

<strong>Crevasse: </strong>Chasm that splits a glacier.

<strong>Dihedral: </strong>Where two walls meet in approximately a right-angled inside corner; also called an <em>open book. </em>

<strong>Moat: </strong>Gap between snow and rock.

<strong>Moraine: </strong>Mounds of rock and debris deposited by a glacier.

[caption id="attachment_345" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Chimney at Rumney, Parking Lot Wall."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_1987.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-345" title="IMG_1987" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_1987-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Objective Hazard: </strong>Physical hazard associated with a route (e.g., rockfall, exposure, high altitude).

<strong>Off-Width: </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5IF77WwAvg">Crack that is too wide for a hand jam</a> but too narrow for chimney technique.

<strong>Scree: </strong>Loose slope of small rock fragments

<strong>Talus: </strong>Rock fragments big enough to step on individually (larger than scree).

&nbsp;

Happy Friday!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost every student who is in love with the outdoors is constantly juggling that passion with more<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4756553.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-388" title="4756553" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4756553.png" alt="" width="182" height="183" /></a> professional and scholarly obligations. Since only a very small percentage of us will go on to live the dream, becoming professional climbers, guides, and photographers, the rest of us are left searching for a way to contribute to society, while having a good time as well.

Every once in a while, however, a perfect opportunity seems to present itself. The NY Times yesterday had an article called "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/us/matching-adventurers-with-scientists.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1">Matches Made in the Wilderness, in the Name of Science</a>" (check out the article for a sweet video). Essentially, it's about an organization called <em><a href="http://www.adventureandscience.org/index.html#open">Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation</a> </em>and they recruit student volunteers to go on mini expeditions to collect data.

[caption id="attachment_391" align="alignright" width="350" caption="PC: NYTimes, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/us/matching-adventurers-with-scientists.html?_r=2&amp;emc=eta1"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-13-at-11.00.54-AM.png"><img class=" wp-image-391 " title="Screen shot 2012-03-13 at 11.00.54 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-13-at-11.00.54-AM.png" alt="" width="350" height="232" /></a>[/caption]

So why students? Why target outdoorsman to help with scientific research? According to Mr.Trenish, the program founder, "“Every single day there are tens of thousands of people who are outside getting after it,' said Mr. Treinish, 30, who was named a <a title="National Geographic Web page" href="http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/2008/12/best-of/deia-schlosberg-gregg-treinish-text">2008 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year</a> for trekking the length of the Andes. 'They’re going to these places that researchers wish that they could get to.'”

It seems like a win-win situation. Researchers get to save time and money by recruiting these volunteers, and outdoorsman get the opportunity to give back and support the areas they frequent the most. Plus, this system allows students to be introduced to field research in a fun way, even if they're not majoring in a scientific discipline. There is research to be done in almost every activity that you could think of: hiking, skiing, biking, kayaking, and gliding. I would highly recommend checking it out. Perhaps on your next backcountry snowshoeing trip, you could be tracking Wolverines too!

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: Cougar Encounters</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-15-at-11.01.50-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-398" title="Screen shot 2012-03-15 at 11.01.50 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-15-at-11.01.50-AM-300x134.png" alt="" width="300" height="134" /></a>

We often talk about what you should do in case you should happen upon a bear on the trail. The advice is confusing: run, don't move, make lots of noise, stay quiet, hit him with a stick, or gently pet him. When it comes down to it, I would have no idea what to do if I ever saw a bear approaching me, black, brown or otherwise. The good news is, after today, we'll all know what to do if a cougar suddenly decides to make friends with us.

[caption id="attachment_399" align="alignright" width="298" caption="But look how cute they are! How could I possibly hit one with a stick? I&#39;d rather take them home..."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/5b3f8c112569cc29280f37e23226e467.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-399  " title="5b3f8c112569cc29280f37e23226e467" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/5b3f8c112569cc29280f37e23226e467.jpeg" alt="" width="298" height="217" /></a>[/caption]

Cougars, sometimes known as panthers or mountain lions, have more recently been seen in the Eastern US, in states such as Maine, Vermont, New York, and Michigan, as well as in the Adirondak and Catskills mountains and areas of California as well. According to <a href="http://www.panthera.org/species/cougar">Panthera.org</a>, the cougar has "has the largest geographic range of any native terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere." However, they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and over hunting by humans.

Although they are beautiful and majestic animals, please resist to urge to pet or snuggle with them. The opposite goes as well: please don't shoot them. Instead, here are some tips on what to do when confronting a cougar from Freedom of Hills.

<strong>Dont' Run: </strong> Running may elicit a chase response in the cougar, and you can't outrun a cougar.

[caption id="attachment_400" align="alignright" width="282" caption="Good luck proving your dominance."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mountain-lion.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-400  " title="mountain-lion" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mountain-lion.jpeg" alt="" width="282" height="189" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Face the Cat: </strong>appear aggressive and large, waving your arms or jacket. Maintain eyeconact.

<strong>Slowly Back Away, </strong>if safe to do so. Never turn your back on a cougar.

<strong>Shout </strong>loudly at the cat.

<strong>Fight back </strong>aggressively. Whack the animal with your trekking pole if it gets close enough. Most cougar attacks are predator-prey attacks. If you seems like a strong predator instead of prey, the cougar will likely back down.

Good Luck!

    <title>Petzl E+Lite® </title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[From cooking a late night dinner to embarking on early morning alpine climbs, headlamps are an essential piece of gear for the outdoor enthusiast. You will, at some point in your life, find yourself out after dark or up before first light. Whether this is intentional or due to poor planning, having a headlamp can not only give you more hours to play, but could quite possibly save your life.<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ONECOL.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-425" title="ONECOL" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ONECOL-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

The $29.99 Petzl E+Lite® is immediately attractive to the college student if for no other reason than its price tag. Unlike many low-cost items out there, this is a highly functional, highly dependable piece of gear. Marketed on the Petzl website under “emergency lighting”, this little lamp can do a whole lot more than get your back. The fully adjustable lycra-blend head strap allows the E+Lite to be worn on almost any part of your body, from your head down to your thigh; just in case you forgot to pack the garter strap for your backcountry wedding. The clip on the back of the lighting unit allows you to attach the unit the edge of a pot or brim of a hat and the three bulbs and five different settings provide light for every occasion, emergency or not. The emergency whistle that functions as the keeper on the headband can be heard from up to 500 meters away, and comes inscribe with an SOS Morse code illustration, in case you haven’t seen Titanic.

&nbsp;

Here are the official tech specs:

Bulb type: LED
Bulb detail: 3 LEDs/ 1 red LED
Red light mode: Yes
Beam type: Flood
Max light output: 16 Lumens
Max beam distance: 19 meters
Beam distance: High: 19/ Low: 11 meters
Brightness levels: 3
Strobes: 2
Average run time: High: 35/ Low 45 hours
Regulated output: No
Rechargeable: No
Batteries: 2 CR2032
Materials: Plastic
Dimensions: 1.75 x 1.25 x 0.75 inches
Weight with batteries: 0.98 oz/28 g

I have used this headlamp while running, camping, reading, braiding my horses mane and on numerous occasions to find things in the dark depths of my dorm room. My favorite feature is the red light mode, which allows you to retain your night vision while tying your shoe or checking the map. At times I have found myself wishing that the beam had a greater max distance. The headband is fully adjustable and can be worn over/under hats, ear warmers and helmets of all shapes and sizes. At purchase, the E+Lite comes in a small, hard plastic case that is better suited to storing bobby pins and illegal substances then keeping your E+Lite safe. Unpacking and repacking it is not worth the time or effort, so I generally keep mine looped to the outside of my backpack or dangling from the rearview mirror of my approach vehicle.

For a lightweight, multi-purpose light, the E+Lite is hard to beat. That being said, I have found myself wishing at times that the beam had a greater max distance and the unpadded plastic backing can get uncomfortable if you start to sweat, but if you don’t ask it to do the job of a full-sized headlamp, I think you will be quite happy. The only thing I truly hate about it is that it is not rechargeable, but that is because I hate using tiny screwdrivers. As a final note, anyone who is working to assemble a serious backcountry first aid kit, I would list this as an essential piece of gear, as you can never have too much light when things go south.

This little light will get your camp set up, your lentils boiled and your nighttime story read. It just won’t get you up to your high alpine summit. Regardless, the E+Lite is a great deal and rumor has it you can find them as cheep as $23 on backcountrygear.com.

<strong>With love and warmth from your #1 gear hound,</strong>

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: Dehydration</title>
    <link>http://www.collegeoutside.com/freedom-of-the-hills-friday-dehydration/</link>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever felt low on energy, headache-y, lethargic, or dizzy, chances are you're probably dehydrated. The average person needs about 2-3 liters of water a day, in their day to day life. But once you start adventuring, you're going to need to start guzzling a lot more than that. You lose water through your sweat, your breath, and other bodily functions, which are greatly increased while exercising. Staying hydrated can not only help you prevent injury, but can help you perform at your top level.

[caption id="attachment_417" align="alignright" width="300" caption="This is what dehydration looks like."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF2213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-417" title="DSCF2213" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DSCF2213-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

Here's what Freedom of the Hills has to say about it:

<em>Always begin mountaineering outings well hydrated. Drink a cup of water or its equivalent 15 minutes before starting out. (</em>Hydrating the day before is just as important.) <em>Once uderway, continue drinking fluids at a rate of 1-1.5 cups (.2-.3 liter) every 20-30 minutes. Don't rely on your sense of thirst as a gauge; drink before you feel thirsty. (</em>As my momma used to say, if you feel thirsty, it's already too late.) <em>If you don't need to urinate periodically, or if your urine color become unusually dark, you aren't drinking enough. (</em>I like to remember the 3 C's of hydration: Clear, Copious, and Frequent.)

<em>
</em>

[caption id="attachment_418" align="alignright" width="240" caption="CamelBaks, or any type of water bladder, are a great way to constantly drink water while you&#39;re moving. Beware of the tube freezing in the winter."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CamelBak-Hydration-Bladder.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-418 " title="CamelBak-Hydration-Bladder" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CamelBak-Hydration-Bladder-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></a>[/caption]

<em><em>Commercial sports drinks aren't necessary, though they can help make fluid replacement more </em>palatable. Juices, if used, should be diluted by at least 50 percent to prevent diarrhea. Electrolytes (body salts) lost through sweating can be replaced by eating snacks that have some salt content (</em>or just have a cup of noodles. There's enough salt in that to last you a lifetime.)

<em>Maintaining good hydration reduces the risk of heat-related illness, cold-related illness (including frostbite), and altitude illness. Your overall physical performance will imporve dramatically too!</em>

Keeping all of these in mind, be wary of hyponatremia—"essentially, intoxication caused by consuming too much water, a ­potentially fatal condition in which cells swell with the excess fluid."

My final two cents: it's easy to remember to drink water when it's hot out, but you lose as much water in cold weather too. Although you may not feel as thirsty or as sweaty, keep drinkin'!

    <title>How To Fill Your Gear Closet Without Going Broke</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[People are in to gear. In to how it looks, how it performs, what it’s made out of, how much it cost, and who made it. Not who, as in the name of the factory worker or craftsman, but who, as in Mountain Hardware, Outdoor Research, Arc’teryx, Black Diamond, etc. Quality is important, but very few gear heads will test multiple products to find the best one, so most decisions are based on brand reputation and advertising. This means that people who consider themselves “hardcore” or “badass” are probably more likely to buy some piece of North Face gear that Alex Honnold is pedaling then an REI generic, regardless of price or quality. I seriously doubt that Ed Viesturs spent his younger years bumming around in a $569 North Face Mountain Manor, and I am 100% sure of the fact that buying one from him will not do a single thing to improve your climbing or your “badass” factor.<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-27-at-3.58.29-PM.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-445" title="Screen shot 2012-03-27 at 3.58.29 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-27-at-3.58.29-PM-300x300.png" alt="" width="216" height="216" /></a>

This is less of a gear review and more of a lesson in why it is important to be a smart consumer. Just because it is made by a big name brand and big time badass is using it in a sexy ad doesn’t mean that it is the right piece of gear for you. It is easy to get fooled into thinking that you need the best possible item avalible, but the reality of it is we are in college. The best is nice to dream about and to fondle in the outlet stores, but we just don't have the bank accounts for it. Don't buy a tent that will work just in case you decide to summit Mt. McKinley before you graduate, buy a tent that will work for all your weekend trips. When you have the tickets paid for, the guide service booked and your fitness level up to snuff, then check out the NEMO Moki or the Mountain Hardware Trango and send me some summit photos.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-27-at-3.59.58-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-447 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2012-03-27 at 3.59.58 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-27-at-3.59.58-PM-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>
&nbsp;

Most of the time, <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/how-to-acquire-cheap-gear/">there is a cheaper alternative </a>that works just as well and looks just as good. The best tent I have ever owned is a $30 Coleman Sundome® 6 Tent (Note: Does not look at fly as a MH tent, but I stay dry). This tent has stayed standing in winds in excess of 70 mph and weathered a Rocky Mountain hailstorm. And it cost a fraction of Mountain Hardware Trango.

I got lucky. I had no prior knowledge of this tent when I bought it, and it worked out great. Not everyone is this lucky and it can be hard to know when you are getting a lemon, so here is a short list of often cheaper options and what I know about them. When in doubt, go by word of mouth and always give yourself a margin for error. If you always bring along something that is capable of doing more than the task at hand, you will avoid a lot of <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/a-valentines-day-disaster-in-the-white-mountains/">accidents and near misses.</a>

<strong>Cheap alternatives to Patagucci, Mountain Haute Couture and The North Face: Never Stop Spending.</strong>

<strong>Stoic</strong>: Literally the shittiest gear. I have only heard bad things.

<strong>L.L Bean:</strong> I love their parkas and rain coats. Not as technical as some brands, but you don’t need all the engineering (and money) that goes into a Patagonia alpine jacket for a day hike. Also, they have an iron-clad guarantee. No matter what, you can always return your gear if it breaks or if you don't like it.

<strong>Coleman</strong>: LOVELOVELOVE, obviously. Tents, sleeping bags, stoves, lanterns, camp chairs, the works. Not a huge selection of backpacking/climbing gear, but for hiking out of a car/cabin-based base camp, their stuff is hard to beat.

<strong>REI</strong>: Ehh, this is a tough call. For the most part, I really like their base layers and their tents aren’t too shabby. My biggest complaint is I don’t find REI brand gear to be enough cheaper for me to take a gamble on something that is not guaranteed. On the plus side, they have a great return policy and stuff at their garage sales are hard to beat.

<strong>EMS </strong>(Eastern Mountain Sports): As a newcomer to the east coast, I was skeptical, but they have toed the line thus far. They also give 15-20% discounts on all products for college students so that is a plus.

<strong>Colombia</strong>: Not a huge savings, but I do like their fleeces and tech/cargo pants.

Do you have a favorite discount brand that I didn't mention? Or maybe a favorite piece of cheap gear?

Share your saves &amp; splurges with your #1 gear hound,

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a HUGE fan of LL Bean gear.  It's not the fastest, lightest, or cheapest gear out there but you can't beat their return policy:  "Our products are guaranteed to give 100% satisfaction in every way.  Return anything purchased from us at any time if it proves otherwise.  We do not want you to have anything from LL Bean that is not completely satisfactory."

Last year I returned a pair of XC skis that broke on a trip to Mt Katahdin.  They were discontinued as a product before I was born and they still gave me a $75 in store credit for the skis.  I've also exchanged (relatively) the same pair of hiking boots three times.  Each pair of boots I had for about two years, wore holes in them here and there, returned them, and picked up the exact same pair again.  The boots cost $100 the first time, but after having three pairs they're only $33 a piece.  At any other place I would have spent $300.  You can't argue with that math.]]></wp:comment_content>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Daniel,

Glad to hear something good about Stoic for a change. Let me know how they hold up long term, as most of the complaints I have heard have to do with durability.

Thanks for the info!!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>Mini Adventures: Dates and Towers</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>During your four years at Tufts, there will come a time when you’ve got a date with that cute girl in TDC or the guy you met in your history class . Most people would ask for a coffee date at Hotung or maybe if they are feeling adventurous, grab some ice cream off campus at JP Licks... but you aren’t most people and you now have access to some of the <strong>best kept secret date spots</strong> around Tufts and Boston. These are for use at sunset, sun rise, preferably with some sort of picnic, and if you’re feeling extra romantic, a bottle of wine.</em>

[caption id="attachment_455" align="aligncenter" width="509" caption="View from the Fells Tower"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FellsView1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-455 " src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FellsView1.jpg" alt="" width="509" height="179" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Theme of the week: Towers!</strong>

· <em>Observation Floor at the top of the Prudential building</em>—Just a quick ride away on the Green Line (get off at the Hynes Convention Center stop), you get a 360 view of Boston. It is open until 10pm from March until October and until 8pm during the winter months. The only downside is that it costs $12 for students but it is worth doing at least once! Inside tip: it says it closes at 10pm but the last elevator up is at 9:30pm so don't miss it!

[caption id="attachment_456" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Wright Tower at the Middlesex Fells"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wrighttowerFells.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-456" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wrighttowerFells-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]

· <em>Observation Tower at Mt. Auburn Cemetary</em>—Mount Auburn Cemetery is not only the resting place of many famous historical characters, well known for its diverse collection of trees, but it is also an ideal view spot for the Boston skyline. It is just 5 minutes from Tufts by car but if that’s not possible, the best way to get there is by bike. There are bike racks where you can lock your bikes while you walk to the Tower at the center of the cemetery. It is free entry but be sure to get there before 6pm when they close! And double check the <a href="http://www.mountauburn.org/">website</a> before going because their hours change with the seasons!

<em>· Wright Tower at the Fells</em>—The Middlesex Fells Reservation is easily one of the best kept secrets around Tufts and therefore it is crucial that you know about it immediately! Just a couple miles or several minutes away from Slummerville, you’ll find yourself immersed in a 2,575 acre forest with two observation towers, a pond, a reservoir, and endless trails! This is the ideal spot for a trail run, mountain biking, some rock climbing if you find the right spots, or just a nice afternoon walk. Since we are talking dates, though, you can’t miss the Wright Tower. It is just a 5-10 minute walk (read: you won't get sweaty in front of your date) a trail from the parking lot to a tower with a view over the Boston Skyline and out to western Mass.

Enjoy!

-Kate

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[In order to avoid being <em>that</em> <a href="http://www.assholeclimbers.com/">asshole climber</a>, there a few things to be aware of before chalking up for your first multi-pitch climb. Most are unspoken rules, and relatively intuitive, but here are a couple of guidelines to get you started. Follow these, and you'll be sure to have a stellar and, more importantly, safe climb.

<strong>The Climbing Code (</strong>according to Freedom of the Hills)<strong>:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Leave a trip itinerary with a responsible person. These should include names, phone numbers, and emergency contacts of all members, as well as a detailed description of your trip and "freak out" time.</li>
  <li>Carry necessary clothing, food, and equipment at all times.</li>
  <li>A climbing party of three is the minimum, unless adequate prearranged support is available. On glaciers, a minimum of two roped teams is recommended.</li>
  <li>Rope up on all exposed places and for all glacier travel. Anchor all belays.</li>
  <li>Keep the party together, and obey the leader or majority rule.</li>
  <li>Never climb beyond your ability and knowledge.</li>
  <li>Never let judgment be overruled by desire when choosing the route or deciding whether to turn back.</li>
  <li>Follow the precepts of sound mountaineering as set forth in books of recognized merit.</li>
  <li>Behave at all times in a manner that reflects favorably upon mountaineering, including adherence to Leave No Trace principles.</li>
</ul>
The way I see it, tell someone where you're going, go with a friend, don't be a jerk, and don't be stupid. Climb on!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[I never thought I would venture to Kentucky for spring break. While most of my peers jetted off to Mexico or Europe or back home for a week of academic respite, I embarked on a 16-hour drive to the Bluegrass state.

What is in Kentucky, anyway?

[caption id="attachment_484" align="alignright" width="256" caption="View of rocks at The Red"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/256px-View_of_Chimney_Top_Rock.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-484 " src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/256px-View_of_Chimney_Top_Rock.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="192" /></a>[/caption]

Upon telling people my spring break plans, I was asked this question a lot. It is a legitimate question. Kentucky is not the typical spring break location.

Well there is some bluegrass music, a lot of cow pastures, and the extraordinary rock-climbing mecca, The Red River Gorge, or commonly known as <em>The Red</em>.

Red River Gorge is a massive canyon system located in east-central Kentucky. It is chock-a-block full with bolted sandstone cliffs, making it an ideal destination for rock climbers. Climbers from all over the world travel to The Red to improve their climbing and set new records. Just last October, 19-year-old Sasha DiGiulian became the first female climber to lead a 5.14d climb in The Red. The place is a big deal in the climbing world.

[caption id="attachment_485" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Not quite my level of climbing...but it&#39;s there!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mike_rrg_title.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-485" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mike_rrg_title-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a>[/caption]

I am fairly new to rock climbing. I have been climbing at an indoor gym for around 6 months and my trip to the Red was my first real, outdoor climbing experience. Even though I was not ascending hard grades in the Red, I still had a phenomenal time climbing mellow routes. Now, after a solid week of a climb-climb-climb mindset, I am dangerously addicted.

The whole atmosphere within the Red is strangely peaceful – climbers from all over the world unite to explore Kentucky rock. There are waterfalls, natural bridges, and pastures that encompass the sandstone cliffs. The Red is a bubble world for enthused climbers.

I went on the trip with 23 others – some very savvy climbers who have scaled the famous Yosemite wall El Capitan and others new to the game like me. Over the course of the week, I was fortunate enough to learn from climbing veterans skills ranging from lead climbing to trad cleaning to proper climbing lingo (I now add “bomber” as a descriptor for an awesome hold).

While the trip was an incredible introduction to outdoor climbing, it was also inexpensive. The costs of the trip amounted to gas, lodging, food, and drink.

As I mentioned before, it is about a 16-hour drive from Boston to the Red. It is a long way. I drove down 5-people to a 5-person car and drove back a leisurely 4-people to a 5-person car. It was a bit cozy but what better ways are there to bond with fellow climbers?  For the round trip, my share of gas expenses ended up being a little under $100. The cost was definitely less than most airfares and brought me to a whole other geographic region of the United States.

The typical lodging for budget climbers in the Red is to pack a sleeping bag and tent and pay $2 a night to camp at a site called Miguel’s. Miguel’s is also a pizza and rock climbing shop and has become a famous hub for climbers in the Red. Chances are if someone’s going to the Red, they’re staying at Miguel’s. At two bucks a night it is completely affordable – and the pizza is delicious.

Instead of lodging at Miguel’s my crew rented a cabin for the week through a company called Scenic Cabin Rentals. It cost $1800 for the full week. Between all of us, we each paid around $80. We rotated who slept on beds and couches and in sleeping bags and it worked really well. For post-climbing entertainment, there was a hot tub and pool table in the cabin. While this lodging was a bit more expensive than camping at Miguel’s, it was totally worth the extra money to take showers, have a kitchen, and relax in the hot tub.

The third greatest expense was food – and booze. The organizers of my trip did a big grocery trip to BJs before the trip and stocked up on dirtbag staples like peanut butter, cheese, cereal, granola bars, beans, and bread. It saved us a lot of money to not buy groceries there and it was satisfying to prepare our own meals.

For a climbing break, a few members of our group drove out to the Kentucky Ale brewery in Lexington, Kentucky to bring back a generous supply of Kentucky Ale for the cabin. There is no better way to complete a day of climbing than with a cold Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. I ended up paying $100 for a week’s worth of food and beer.

My spring break cost me under $300. I enjoyed the beauty of Kentucky. Best of all, I had an incredible time learning to climb and soaking up the climbing lifestyle. Give me the Red over Cancun any spring break.

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Nicole!
So exciting you're heading to the Red. It's probably going to be pretty warm down there so you won't need a lot of warm clothing items. It'll be sunny so bring lots of block and maybe clothes to protect you from the sun but light enough to climb in comfortably.
My biggest recommendation would be to bring your own food so you don't have to buy it down there!
For sure let me know if you have any more questions.
Have an awesome time!!]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>P-Cord, the Multi-Use and Essential Piece of Gear</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever need to tie up a bear bag? Ever wished you could attach your spoon to your mug? Ever camped in high winds and need to stabilize your tent? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need P-Cord. After a good knife and a lighter, P-cord is the most essential piece of gear to pack for any sized adventure.

<strong>History:</strong>

P-Cord, formally known as Parachute Cord, also known as 55o cord, was first used during World War II in the suspension lines of US military parachutes. It didn’t take long for paratroopers to realize it had countless other uses in the field. The braided sheath has a high number of interwoven strands that give it a smooth texture in hand and the all-nylon constrctions makes it fairly elastic, which, depending on the task at hand, is either an asset or a liability. A single length has been tested to handle 550 lbs  of weight.<strong>              </strong>

<strong></strong><strong> <img class="thumbimage" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Paracord-Commercial-Type-III-Inch-Scale.jpg/220px-Paracord-Commercial-Type-III-Inch-Scale.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="193" /></strong>    <img style="padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;" src="http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FLS/DGCM/G7DY8666/FLSDGCMG7DY8666.MEDIUM.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200" />        <img class="rg_i" style="margin: 0 0 0 -2px;" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRN45s6ROvq6TCXlSzY87jaim4b3LcAqPa-KkjBFinUsIcG3FYZ" alt="" width="213" height="142" />

<strong>Uses:</strong>

<strong></strong>-Belt
-Attach things to your pack
-Attach thing to your person
-Attach things to your car
-Attach things to others packs or cars
-Repair torn clothing: dissect outer sheath to get an individual thread
-Tow rope
-Clothes line
-Shoe laces
-Zipper pull
-Dental floss: dissect to get an individual thread
-Leash (dog, rabbit, or child)
-Tie up a person
-Rig a trip wire
-Make pulley system
-Make faisonable and functional bracelets
-Secure tents
-Practice knots

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[This weeks Mini-Adventures from Tufts are for all you water lovers out there. Whether you're looking for a swim, sail, kayak, or long walk on the beach, all of these are within spitting distance of Boston, and perfect for an afternoon or weekend adventure.

<strong><em><strong>Mystic Lake</strong>— </em></strong>Upper Mystic Lake, the practice location of Tufts’ very own <a href="http://sites.tufts.edu/sailing/">Sailing team</a>, is the perfect place to get away from the heat on a warm fall or spring day (and most definitely summer if you are around!). It is just 3.5 miles away from campus and one of the cleanest lakes in Massachusetts. You may get there by car, bike, or if you’re feeling ambitious, running (you can jump in the water to cool off once you get there). During the fall and spring, you may catch a sailing regatta on the weekends. However, the best time for swimming is late summer or early fall when the water is like a bath tub and way warmer than the ocean! It’s a great place to kayak, do swimming training for triathlons, or go for a sail if you can find someone who will take you for a ride.

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mystic-Lake.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-498" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mystic-Lake.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>

<strong><em><strong>Crane Beach</strong> -</em></strong> This beach is a year-round favorite. Located on the north shore in Ipswich, MA<em>, </em>it’s a slightly complicated/weather-dependent trip without a car (Red Line+ Green Line +North Station+Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Rail line+bike 5 miles to the beach) but with a car, it is just under an hour to get there and it is worth the trip! About a ½ mile before hitting the beach, you’ll pass Russell Orchards, a crucial pit stop. You can stop here to pick up picnic food for your afternoon at the beach, go strawberry or apple picking depending on the season, get ice cream and homemade fudge, or my personal favorite: grab a dozen of their home made hot apple cider donuts (the best donuts you will ever taste). From here you can make your way to the beach but be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/places-to-visit/northeast-ma/crane-beach-admission-prices.html">prices</a>. It can be pricey as a non-member since the beach is also a reservation. You can really make a day of the trip by checking out the Crane Estate, a mansion on the hill next to the beach. If you have the time, the mansion and grounds are stunning and worth taking a stroll around.

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Crane-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-499" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Crane-1.jpg" alt="" width="363" height="245" /></a>

<strong><em><strong>Halibut Point</strong>-</em></strong> While Halibut Point State Park is probably not worth a trip in itself, it is worth mentioning so that you can tack it on to another trip up to the north shore (like the one to Crane beach!). With views from Massachusetts up to Maine, sun rise and sun set are the most ideal times to hit the view spot, which is just a 5 minute walk from the parking lot. It’s the perfect way to begin or end the day!

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Halibut_point.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Halibut_point.jpg" alt="" width="860" height="480" /></a>

<strong><em><strong>Castle Island Gazebo-</strong> </em></strong>Castle Island is part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston (I bet you didn’t know Boston even had a park system...) and is located in South Boston in Boston Harbor.<em> </em>It’s a T and bus ride away from Tufts or about 30 minutes on a bike and offers a great view of Boston Harbor, the other islands, and sail boats racing in regattas in between! The island has a running/walking loop around the bunker, a beach, and a perfect gazebo view spot at the edge of the inner body of water, Pleasure Bay (yes, that’s its real name-you heard it here first). This is a great trip to do using <a href="http://tuftsbikes.wordpress.com/">TuftsBike</a>s on a free weekend and you can follow it up by grabbing dinner in Boston on the way back!

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Castle-Island.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Castle-Island.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" /></a>

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: How to Poop in the Woods</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[This article is more directed at those of you gifted enough to actually be able to relieve yourself when out on a long hike. Others of us suffer for a few days, praying for an outhouse, or even a tree stump that resembles a toilet seat. Don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly a modest person. I have more more than once smiled and waved at somebody as they walked by me doing number 1 not far enough off the trail. Perhaps it's a mental block to not be able to do the former. Anyways, I digress.<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GRT-ND11-mountain-outhouse-i.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-529" title="GRT-ND11-mountain-outhouse-i" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GRT-ND11-mountain-outhouse-i-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>

<strong>How to Poop in the Woods: </strong>

<em>Freedom of the Hills: Choose a site at least 200 ft  (60 m) away from watercourses, trails, and campsites. If it's easy for you to reach, it will be for others too! When finished, tamp soil down and scatter with vegetation to create a natural appearance. Pack out toilet paper. <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cathole-drawing-400.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-528" title="cathole-drawing-400" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cathole-drawing-400-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a></em>

Many campsites, at least along the AT, will have compostable outhouses (brilliant really, the compost keeps the odor down). But if you find your self running out of time in the middle of a trail, drop your pack and hustle far enough away to keep fellow hikers at bay. I also <em>highly</em> recommend bringing some sort of toilet paper. Leaves can work in a dire situation, but are you <em>100% sure</em> that's not poison ivy? Baby wipes are also a phenomenal investment, especially for longer trips. Oh, and fiber bars.

:)

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Inhale, bump, exhale, lock off, inhale, heel hook, exhale, clip in. Relax. Om.

Yoga and climbing have a lot in common. Both require you to calm your mind, work hard, and find your edge.

The activities are perfect complements for one another – both supporting variations of strength, balance, and calm. Whether stuck in a sweaty Warrior 3 or on a heinous crimp, you learn to take a deep breath and push yourself to the next pose or move.

Here is an assortment of yoga poses you can do to enhance your climbing abilities and train your mental stamina for the rock ahead! I have also included the Sanskrit pronunciation of the poses so you can impress your climber-yogi friends with your ancient language mastery.

[caption id="attachment_544" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="This could be you!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BKB-photoyoga.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BKB-photoyoga-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open up the<strong> Hips </strong></span>

Kapotasana (Cap-poh-TAHS-anna)- Pigeon Pose

Begin on all fours in a tabletop position (wrists under shoulders and knees under hips). Slide your right knee behind your right wrist and try to work your right shin in line with the front edge of your yoga mat. Slowly extend your left leg out behind you and uncurl your toes. Distribute your weight evenly between your hips and walk your hands out in front of you to rest your elbows or shoulders on the ground. You should feel a pretty intense stretch in your right hip. Repeat on the other side.

[caption id="attachment_540" align="aligncenter" width="248" caption="Pigeon Pose"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2845-32.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-540" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2845-32.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="248" /></a>[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stretch the <strong>Hamstrings</strong></span>

Uttanasana (OOT-tan-AHS-ahna) - Standing Forward Bend

Stand tall with your hands by your sides and shoulders down. As you exhale, bend forward from your hip joints and allow your head to come towards the ground. Continue to breath and release any tension from your neck and shoulders to get a deeper stretch. You should feel a deep stretch in the backs of your legs.

[caption id="attachment_541" align="aligncenter" width="248" caption="Standing forward bend. For shoulder stretch: interlace hands behind back and allow arms to fall forward. "]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HP_209_Uttanasana_248.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-541" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HP_209_Uttanasana_248.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="248" /></a>[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loosen your <strong>Shoulders</strong></span>

In Uttanasana, interlace your hands behind your back and allow your arms to fall forward over your head. This should bring a deep stretch to loosen up your shoulders.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice <strong>Balance</strong></span>

Bakasana (bahk-AHS-anna) – Crow Pose

Come to a squat on the floor with a few inches between your feet. Place your hands fully on the ground in front of you. Bend your elbows directly above your wrists. Slowly start to move your knees to rest on your elbows. Try to balance with your feet off the ground. It helps to find a point to look at in front of you!

&nbsp;

Great balance practice!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HP_202_Bakasana_248.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-542" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HP_202_Bakasana_248.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="248" /></a>[/caption]

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: Leave No Trace</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/patch.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-601" title="patch" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/patch.gif" alt="" width="150" height="149" /></a>Lovers of the outdoors face a major paradox every time they venture outside: the pristine nature that we value so much is impacted negatively with every step that we take. We want to spend weeks in the mountains, but every time we set down our tent and build a fire to keep warm, we create a footprint that, when multiplied by the millions of outdoorsmen, creates a serious impact. There are certain methods we've learned over the years in order to minimize our impact, such as clean climbing practices and making sure to  "Leave no Trace." By being acutely aware of our actions and our environment, we can keep our wilderness wild.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Leave No Trace Policy</strong></span> by Freedom of the Hills:

1) <strong>Plan ahead and prepare: </strong>Choose a realistic objective and check regulations. Limit party size. Eliminate excess packaging before you head out.

2) <strong>Travel and camp on durable surfaces: </strong>Stay on existing trails; spread out if off-trail. Camp at least 200 feet (60m) from water, trails, and people. Avoid clustering tents. Never level campsites, remove leaves or needles, or dig tranches.

3) <strong>Dispose of waste properly. </strong><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/freedom-of-the-hills-friday-how-to-poop-in-the-woods/">Dig a cat hol</a>e; pack out toilet paper. Urinate on bare grounds or rocks. When camping on snow or ice, concentrate urine in a designated spot; cover yellow snow (and definitely don't eat it). On steep rock or ice faces, stream urine away from climbing route.

4) <strong>Leave what you find: </strong> Avoid disturbing vegetation or rocks on climbing routes.

5) <strong>Minimize campfire impacts: </strong>Use only stoves; campfire rings and blackened trees may last for decades.

6) <strong>Respect wildlife: </strong>Never feed wildlife. Watch for nesting birds, especially raptors, on rock routes.

<strong>7) Be Considerate of other visitors: </strong>Camp away from other people; respect their privacy and avoid traveling through their space; speak quietly.

Happy Weekend!

Sarah

    <title>Dirty Running: Obstacle Mud Runs</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[With summer coming around, most of us can’t wait for the long days when we’ll be able to romp around and get active in the warm sun. This also means race season for lots of runners. But this year, in addition to running the same community 5K for the tenth time, try mixing it up with an obstacle mud run. This type of race is becoming increasingly popular and typically gives out free beer and a sweet swag bag. You'll be sure to have a great time with one of these popular series:

[caption id="attachment_617" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Jumping over a fire obstacle in Spartan Race"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Spartan-Race1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-617" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Spartan-Race1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Spartan Race </strong>will have you running under barbed wire, climbing over walls, crossing rivers by jumping over a raft bridge, jumping through fire, carrying heavy things, running past Spartan warriors with foam barbells, and of course, sloshing through mud the whole way through. This large series of mud races tours with 3 race distances, called the <strong>Spartan Sprint (5K), Super Spartan (8+ miles)</strong>, and the <strong>Spartan Beast (10-12 miles)</strong>. A nice bonus with this series is that if you sign up, they’ll send you Workouts-of-the-Day and invite you to an online community of other “Spartans” to prep you for your race. Check out race locations online at <strong><a title="Spartan Race" href="http://www.spartanrace.com//" target="_blank">spartanrace.com</a></strong>. Prices vary from $60 to $100 depending on how early you register.

The <strong>Warrior Dash </strong>series is another very similar mud run, except that it only offers races about <strong>5K distance</strong>. Warrior Dash tours nationally, so check <strong><a title="Warrior Dash" href="http://warriordash.com/" target="_blank">warriordash.com</a></strong> and prices vary from $65 to $75 depending on how early you register.

And if you want to take it up a notch, try upping the distance to <strong>7 miles</strong> and running the whole course at night with <strong>Ultimate Mud Run-Night Ops</strong>. Sign up for the next event (tours nationally) at <strong><a title="Ultimate Mud Run" href="http://ultimatemudrun.com/" target="_blank">ultimatemudrun.com</a> </strong>and it costs $129 and under, once again, depending on when you register.

[caption id="attachment_621" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Plenty of opportunities to fall into muddy water"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tough-mudder_2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-621 " src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tough-mudder_2-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Tough Mudder</strong> is the ultimate mud run that separates the athletes from the bad-asses. Tough Mudder is another touring series of <strong>10-12mi</strong> obstacle course runs ready to kick your behind good and hard. With a grueling course designed by British Special Forces, have fun jumping into tanks of ice water, running through fire, climbing over everything imaginable, and crawling through mud the whole way. Oh, did I mention the last obstacle is a tunnel of hanging electric live wires? Some carrying up to 10,000 volts? All this pain is philanthropic though, because Tough Mudder supports the Wounded Warrior Project, which provides recovery programs to wounded United States veterans, and has already earned almost $3 million for the project. Sign up for this international series at <strong><a title="Tough Mudder" href="http://toughmudder.com/" target="_blank">toughmudder.com</a> </strong>with registration costing between $95 and $200.

I’m signed up for Warrior Dash and Spartan Sprint this summer.

Think you have what it takes?]]></content:encoded>

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Generally all of these races will give you discounts or even free races if you volunteer for their street team (online marketing, promo codes, event booths) or if you volunteer the day of the race.  For example, I'm on the street team for Spartan Races, and for every 8 hours I volunteer I get a free race.  They also give me a promo code (punch in my code MASPARTA025 for 10% off your registration fee).  There's some other cool bonuses as well.  So generally you can find a way around paying full price because some of these races can be expensive.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <title>The North Face® Base Camp Duffel </title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Once upon a time, someone put some handles on some canvas and called it a duffle bag. Ever since that day, Boy Scouts, Army Rangers and Soccer Moms have been loading variations of this simple design with all their worldly possessions. And then trying to carry them.

After decades of sore arms and awkward shuffles, the North Face Base Camp Duffle came along. Waterproof, durable, and easy to carry under any conditions. Pile it onto your roof rack, lash it to your sled, put it on your back, just don’t it them behind. One of the greatest challenges of any kind of travel, adventure or otherwise, is how to transport your necessary accessories to your destination. From taking your boots and helmet to Portillo to getting your rack to Indian Creek, these bags are a must have for the well (and perhaps overly) accessorized traveler.

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-30-at-11.44.01-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-705" title="Screen shot 2012-04-30 at 11.44.01 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-30-at-11.44.01-AM.png" alt="" width="271" height="273" /></a>

&nbsp;

The most notable feature of the Base Camp Duffels (other then the color selection) are their padded, fully adjustable straps that allow to you carry them on your back. While there is no frame, the bags are comfortable enough wear as you wander the streets of your destination city seeking shelter. Each long side is lined with gear loops to facilitate easy attachment to yaks, Land Rovers and all other means of transportation. The D-shaped zipper opening allows large objects to be placed inside with ease and a small, transparent window lets you label the bag as yours. Made of a waterproof laminate material, the Base Camp can left unattended in the elements while you pitch your tent or negotiate hostel fares. Watch any of today’s adventure/ski/climbing films and you are likely to see these bags being unloaded from the belly of a jet on some foreign tarmac.

They come in every size, from the Mini, which contains my first aid kit, to the XL, which I can zip myself inside:

•Avg Weight [Mini] 7 oz (200 g)
•[Small] 2 lbs 12 oz (1250 g)
•[Medium] 3 lbs 8 oz (1600 g)
•[Large] 4 lbs (1820 g)
•[XLarge] 4 lbs 15 oz (2240 g)

•Volume [Mini] 250 in3 (4 liters)
•[Small] 2560 in3 (42 liters)
•[Medium] 4200 in3 (70 liters)
•[Large] 5600 in3 (90 liters)
•[XLarge] 9070 in3 (140 liters)

•# Dimensions [Mini] 5 in. x 10 in. x 5 in. (12 cm x 24 cm x 12 cm)
•# Dimensions [Small] 20 in. x 12 in. x 12 in. (51 cm x 31 cm x 31 cm)
•# Dimensions [Medium] 24 in. x 15 in. x 15 in. (61 cm x 38 cm x 38 cm)
•# Dimensions [Large] 28 in. x 16 in. x 16 in. (71 cm x 41 cm x 41 cm)
•# Dimensions [XLarge] 32 in. x 19 in. x 19 in. (81 cm x 48 cm x 48 cm)

A note on the quality of North Face luggage:

The North Face backpack I use to lug my books around campus is the same North Face backpack I took with me on my first international trip.

That was in 1995.

There have been a few zipper replacements along the way, and a burn scar on the small pocket make it mine, but it is still standing, 17 years later. I have faith that the Base Camps will hold up just as well.

The duffels range from $100-$175, depending on size and are available at most major outdoor retailers, such as REI and EMS.

XOXO

    <title>Midnight Bike Ride of the Boston Marathon</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Marathon Monday is a glorious tradition in Boston that falls on Patriots day every April. The majority of the city has a holiday from work and spends it cheering on the over 27,000 champions that choose to spend their day running/walking/crawling 26.2 miles through the treacherous Boston Marathon course. For those of us who chose to pass, there were many other ways to participate in the Bostonian spirit, without worrying about heatstroke for 4-5 hours.  You can volunteer either directly through the BAA (Boston Athletic Association) or through your school. Tufts, for example, is responsible for the water stations at miles 10, 11 and 22. Volunteering is an awesome experience, and you get a free jacket and hat for your time. I’ve done it two years now, and highly recommend it. You have to sign up early, however, as volunteer spots are very coveted.

There is another Boston tradition, however, that I just found out about this year. It is the annual <a href="http://www.bostonsos.org/adventure/boston-midnight-marathon/117-2012-boston-midnight-marathon-recap.html">midnight bike ride of the marathon course</a> the night before the actual race, when the barriers and mile markers are all set up. It is a free unofficial race, sponsored by no one, but organized by <a href="http://www.bostonsos.org/">BostonSOS</a>. This is how the event went down this year:

Around 11 pm, we rolled into the Back Bay commuter rail station and crossed our fingers that the train hadn’t completely filled up at South Station. (The organizers asked that you show up at South Station at 10:15pm for the 11 pm train, since it takes forever to get 400 people and their bikes into a train.) By 11:30 we were all packed in, bikes piled on top of each other on top of seats, and the rest of the empty spaces filled with people in spandex talking about the ride last year and whether or not it was going to rain.

[caption id="attachment_641" align="alignright" width="288" caption="Waiting for everyone to unload the train and get started, pre-rain."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/click.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-641  " title="click" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/click.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="216" /></a>[/caption]

Imagine 500 people and bikes in the middle of the street in the middle of the night, head and tail lights flashing, electrifying the normally quiet area of SouthBorough. There were many different types of people there, from pro-triathletes to people on mountain bikes with hipster sneakers on, but everyone was just pumped to be there. We were just about to start the 3 mile ride to the Marathon starting line when the skies opened up and it started to rain.

And so we biked in the rain.

There were multiple reasons why I was nervous for this ride:

[caption id="attachment_642" align="alignright" width="300" caption="My poor seat was in pieces by the end of the race."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-642" title="photo (7)" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo-7-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a>[/caption]

1) I had never biked more than 15 miles before, and I was about to double that distance.
2) My seat was being held together by duct tape.
3) My “bike light” was my weak headlamp wrapped around my handlebars.
4) I was sure that someone was going to wipe out in front of me and I was going to die.

Reasons I was nervous for other people:

1)<a href="http://www.thehubway.com/"> Hubway bikes</a> + tutus + beer.

2) The dude on roller skates.

Worries aside, the rain cleared after about 20 minutes and I had one of the best bike rides of my life. It was truly awesome to bike through the normally heinous streets of Boston without worrying for my life.  It’s events like these that make city living a little less awful, especially when you know that some cool, athletic people are hiding out there too, ready to emerge when the awesomeness calls.

      <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lessons Learned:

1.)  Eat before a midnight bike ride, it's probably a good 5 or 6 hours since eating dinner.  One Tufts kid almost passed out on his bike b/c he hadn't eaten since dinner.  So he pulled over to a randomly open gas station and bought 5 power bars.

2.)  Have someone in your crew bring a med kit.  If you fall off your bike 15 miles from Boston while it's raining at 2am, it'll be a while before anyone comes to help you.  We didn't bring a medical kit and luckily nothing bad happened but we did see three people who had fallen over, could have easily been one of us.

3.)  Bring a small backpack for adventure rides like this.  Your bike can typically carry your water and if you have a seat pouch you can carry your wallet, phone, keys but as with any adventure, what are you going to do if things go wrong and no one is there to help you?  A med kit, rain jacket, and food would have been good items to bring and  a small backpack would have been perfect for this.

4.)  Beware train tracks.  2/3 of the people we saw on the side of the road who had fallen where there because of slippery train tracks.

5.)  Have some snacks at your apt/dorm waiting for you when you get back with the munchies at 3am.

6.)  Wear a costume and strap a battery-powered radio to your handlebars.

Had a blast at the race, it's already in my calendar for next year.]]></wp:comment_content>

And for the record, our semi-official count was around 600 bikes and people on the train, and around 700 after we joined up with the people waiting at Southborough statiion. See you next year for our 5th Annual midnight marathon ride!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Poor communication is one of the most dangerous mistakes you can make while out on a rock climb. Whether you're sport climbing or doing a long multi-pitch, clear and concise communication is essential to getting you and your partners up and down safely.

Here are a few basic commands that you will hear anywhere from a climbing gym to a gnarly alpine route. Climber refers to any climber on top rope or on lead. Leader refers to commands specific to lead climbers and their belayers.

<strong>Climber: "</strong>On belay?" (Do you have me on belay?)

[caption id="attachment_667" align="alignright" width="300" caption="On Belay!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/149413_838831717368_1705074_38106989_1172504990_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-667" title="149413_838831717368_1705074_38106989_1172504990_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/149413_838831717368_1705074_38106989_1172504990_n-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Belayer: </strong>"Belay On." (I'm belaying you.)

<strong>Climber:</strong> "Climbing." (I'm moving up and on the rock so pay attention.)

<strong>Belayer: "</strong>Climb or Climb On." (The belayer acknowledging that they're paying attention.)

<strong>Climber: </strong>"Slack." (Give me some slack and leave it out until I call "Climbing.")

<strong>Climber: "</strong>That's me." (All slack is pulled in; don't pull any more or I'll fall off.)

<strong>Climber: "</strong>Watch me." (I anticipate a fall or difficult move.)

<strong>Climber: </strong>"Falling" or what I normally say "AHHHH." (Assume braking position and brace for a pull on the rope.)

<strong>Leader: "</strong>Take!" (I expect to weight the rope or fall; take up slack and apply braking force.)

[caption id="attachment_668" align="alignright" width="300" caption="These commands are key if your partner is out of sight."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/292113_838832914968_1705074_38107026_101522051_n.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-668" title="292113_838832914968_1705074_38107026_101522051_n" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/292113_838832914968_1705074_38107026_101522051_n-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>Leader: </strong>"How much rope?" (What length of rope remains?)

<strong>Belayer: </strong>"Feet...four...zero." (40 Feet remains.)

<strong>Leader: </strong>"Off Belay." (I'm secure; take belay apart and prepare to follow the pitch.)

<strong>Follower: </strong>"Belay off." (After taking apart the belay. Pull in slack and remaining coils when you're ready.)

<strong>Anyone: "</strong>ROCK! ICE!" (Loudly repeat until falling object stops. Do not look up.)

<strong>Anyone: </strong>"Rope!" (Rappel rope is about to be thrown down; look out and take cover.)

<strong>Climber: "</strong>On rappel!" (I'm about to rappel.)

&nbsp;

Climb on!

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[Time to put in some major mileage.

Since coming to Tufts, I’ve become more intensive with my running because I’ve found it’s the perfect sport for a busy college student. I can chose when I run, how far, and how to train for a major event. It’s come to mean much more to me than just a way to stay in shape. When I run, it’s like running away from and running towards something all at the same time. I literally run away from any stress I have on campus, but at the same time I’m running towards a larger goal of seeing the limits of where my body can take me.  Then, when I race and finish well, it gives me more confidence to keep reaching further.

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Marathon.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-674" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Marathon-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>The other day I ran an 11.11-mile long run. And felt great about it. I ran at a good pace and could have kept going, but it was getting dark and I did not want to be running in the city at night. The fact that I could go that far made me so proud about what my body could do. <em>But I still want more.</em>

<strong>So I have decided to run a half-marathon.</strong>

To achieve this goal, I will follow a training schedule from CoolRunning.com, and will follow the intermediate plan. This website has a lot of great training plans for the most popular distances, from a Couch-to-5K plan to a marathon plan. I invite you to join me in training for a half!

<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/OPHM5K-2012-TEE-300x300.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-675" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/OPHM5K-2012-TEE-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Since starting the plan a couple weeks ago, it puts me at a race date around July. I’m pretty sure I’m going to do the ShipYard Old Port Half Marathon in Portland, Maine on July 22<sup>nd</sup>. I want to run it under 2 hours, which I'm sure for me is doable, considering I ran the 11.11 miles in a little under an hour and a half. <em><strong>Follow me as I’ll be posting training updates as I get to my goal! </strong></em>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[There is no true replacement for enjoying time outdoors. Hiking in the mountains, climbing outside, or paddling in the waves are activities that can’t be replicated. Being outside is being outside.

However, if you need a little procrastination break in the library or are stranded in the urban jungle, here are some of my favorite websites, blogs, and podcasts to keep the adventurous spirit alive.

<em><a href="http://www.thecleanestline.com" target="_blank">The Cleanest Line:</a> </em>This is the company Patagonia’s blog. It includes stories and thoughts from Patagonia employees and ambassadors. While it seems like it would be a shameless plug for Patagonia gear, it really isn’t. Instead the blog documents the crazy travels of its ambassadors and cool environmental/sustainability initiatives. My favorite posts range from one about the logistics of van yoga to interviews with killer climbers.

Check is out at <a href="http://www.thecleanestline.com">www.thecleanestline.com</a>

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://www.highinfatuation.com" target="_blank">High Infatuation: </a></em>This is a lifestyle/climbing/vegan living blog written by climber Stephanie Davis. Davis is a well-known climber and PrAna ambassador who is based out of Moab, Utah. High Infatuation offers great climbing advice (how to successfully tape blistered hands), yummy vegan recipes, and glimpses into her outdoor adventures. If you want to zone out and watch something beautiful, check out her collection of videos base-jumping and wingsuit flying. Absolutely incredible.

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://www.semi-rad.com" target="_blank">Semi-Rad</a>: </em>I was just introduced to this blog and I already love it. The posts are interesting and humorous ranging from “The Rules for Dating a Dirtbag” about the realities of dating fellow outdoors-ites to the issue of not sounding sophisticated in “Dude, is it OK if I call you Dude?” Funny and true, definitely check out <a href="http://www.semi-rad.com">www.semi-rad.com</a>

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://www.prana.com/blog/" target="_blank">Prana Blog:</a> </em>This one is just fun. It definitely advertises Prana clothing more explicitly than Patagonia does on The Cleanest Line, but it still has some cool outdoors and environmental videos. If you make it to this blog, watch the “inside game” video series that features Chris Sharma, Dean Potter, and Steph Davis – they are all about how they control their thoughts and emotions to push the edge, free solo a route, or base jump.

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://enormocast.com/">The Enormocast</a>: </em>An entertaining podcast about climbing life. Hosted by climber and self-proclaimed dirtbag Chris Kalous, <em>The Enormocast</em> is a reinvention of the podcast <em>Off Belay.</em> Past episodes include an extended interview with Hayden Kennedy about the Cerro Torre controversy, Sam Lightner from the Access Fund, and Steph Davis about climbing and flying. While the podcast is still young, with only nine episodes, it is informative and amusing – give it a listen!

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://www.dirtbagdiaries.com/"> The Dirtbag Diaries:</a> </em>This amazing podcast features stories and tales from adventurers in every walk of life. As a postcast, you can listen to these stories on the way to work or on your drive up to your favorite crag. Their blog also provides an awesome selection of music.

&nbsp;

<em><a href="http://www.assholeclimbers.com/" target="_blank">Asshole Climbers:</a> </em>Just read it. It's hilarious. Don't take them too seriously.

&nbsp;

Enjoy, but don’t spend too much time online. Get outside!]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[This past April, the 116<sup>th</sup> Boston Marathon was run in record breaking temperatures that topped out at 87 degrees. Over the course of the day, approximately 2100 participants were treated by the volunteer medical staff; an increase of almost 800 over last year.  One patient arrived at a hospital with a body temperature of 108-degrees. With the arrival of summer on the horizon, and many of us eager to take advantage of the warm weather, it is important to understand the toll high temperatures can take on your body, and how to keep yourself cool and safe on your adventures.<img style="padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;" src="http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2012/04/16/1334633602_3101/539w.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="342" />

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding how your body cools itself</span></strong>

Your body loses heat four ways:

<strong>Conduction</strong>-heat lost from direct contact with something cooler then you

<strong>Radiation</strong>- heat lost directly from skins surface

<strong>Convection</strong>- heat lost through movement of air around your body

<strong>Evaporation</strong>-vaporization of sweat

On a hot day, <strong>Evaporation </strong>is the only method that effectively cools you. Unfortunately, the actual production of sweat does nothing, it has to be able to evaporate as well. In hot, dry climates, like my native New Mexico, this is extremely effective. In humid conditions, like Boston, evaporation becomes less and less effective.

When your body cannot effectively release heat, your internal temperature begins to rise and bad things, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, start to happen. Many people use these terms interchangeably, but they are very different conditions, and knowing the difference can save a life.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symptoms of Heat Exhaustion:</span></strong>

-Headache
-Dizziness
-Nausea
-Rapid breathing
-Exhaustion
-Skin feels cool, has goose bumps
-Chills

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Heat Exhaustion:</span>

-Move victim into the shade
-Oral rehydration with a slightly salty drink
-It takes an hour to get a liter back into circulation, so the recovery process will be slow

-<strong>Not physiologically damaging-but can lead to heat stroke if left untreated</strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heat Stroke:</span></strong>

-Sudden and very noticeable alteration in mental function: disorientation, irritability, combativeness, bizarre delusions, and incoherent speech
-Skin is hot, red, wet
-Elevated vitals

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Heat Stroke:</span>

-Quick cooling-cold water, ice applied to circulation centers
-If this cannot be accomplished where you are, then evacuation
-<strong>Physiologically damaging-can be deadly</strong>

The easiest way to avoid becoming a victim is to know when to stay inside. NOAA has a Heat Index table that indicates how hot it is and how hot it actually feels when relative humidity is factored with actual air temperature, as well as the likelihood of acquiring a heat disorder with prolonged exposure.

Whether you are a seasoned warm-weather runner, or a newbie, here are some tips to keep you safe while you are out there getting after it (these also apply to similar activities such as hiking and biking).

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Run</span></strong>

The best thing you can do for yourself <strong>is to be adequately hydrated before you start.</strong> If you are running in the morning, this means making sure you drink a lot of water the evening before, especially if you have been consuming alcohol. And forgo your morning coffee, or at least postpone it until after your run.

This is often out of your control, <strong>but if you are feeling sick, think twice</strong> about facing the heat. Being sick can affect your ability to thermoregulate effectively, which is bad-news-bears when efficient cooling is essential.

If you are a cool weather critter, and this whole heat thing seems a little weird, <strong>give your body time to adjust,</strong> just like you would acclimate if you went up in elevation. This can take up to 2-3 weeks, so be patient.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gear:</span> </strong>So you can’t control the weather, but just like with the cold and the wet, you can dress for the occasion.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Head</span>

Soak a <strong>light-colored, brimmed hat</strong> in water and put in the fridge. Put it on just before you head out the door.

Invest in some <strong>sports sunglasses</strong> that stay put when you run and don’t fog up when you sweat. Oakley Half-Jackets are sexy (And Lance wears them), but I have had great success with $8 gas station wrap-arounds.

<strong>Wear a hat. Not a visor</strong>. Athletes are one of the groups most at risk for developing skin cancer. Parts, receding hairlines and championship season buzz cuts are just as vulnerable to burns as the bridge of your nose. Get one that is easily adjustable, and of a wicking fabric and works with your bun/ponytail/braid configuration of choice.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neck</span>

Invest in <strong><a href=" http://www.kooltie.com/">Kafka Kool Tie</a>, </strong>a cotton bandana filled with polymer crystals that soak up and then slowly release water to create a prolonged evaporative cooling effect. If you don’t have the $10, a regular bandana can be soaked in water and used in the same manner. This won’t last as long, but is a good trick, especially when hiking along a stream, where it can we re-wetted frequently.

Long sleeves may seem counter intuitive in the heat, but <strong>a light weight long-sleeved wicking shirt</strong> is essential for running in hot weather. The light color will reflect some of the heat from the sun, and the wicking fabric will keep your skin temperature lower for longer.

When running for longer than an hour, especially on your own, away from civilization, you need to <strong>bring water</strong>. You DO NOT need a Fuel Belt, a CamelBack, or special hand-held bottle. A plastic water bottle or any bottle that fits in your hand (sorry, no sticker-covered Nalgenes, these are unbelievably hard to run with) placed inside of a tube sock will get the job done. The sock will absorb the sweat from your hand and the condensation form the water bottle. I, personally, find that carrying water in my hand is way less annoying then carrying on my back or around my waist, but you will have to experiment to find out what is the most comfortable for you. The one exception to this is if I am going for longer then two hours away from any form of support. Then I grab a hydration pack.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Run</span></strong>

Now that you have dressed for the occasion, tailor the occasion to the conditions. Making plans according to the weather is just as important in the heat as the cold.

Avoid the heat and <strong>run early or late.</strong> Look at the forecast for the next day and plan to be finishing your run before the heat becomes intolerable. In places like Phoenix or Miami, it is not uncommon for people to run as early as 3:30 in the morning to avoid the heat. While this is extreme, changing when you exercise will keep you cooler then anything else.

Plan your run on an <strong>out and back </strong>course so you can leave yourself a water cache on the way out. This was you don’t have to carry your water the whole way and can go for longer without having to carry a pack.

<strong>Slow down and lower your expectations</strong>. You cannot perform as well in 90 degree heat as you can in 60 degree heat. Period. End of story. Be smart and back off, especially if you feel sick or dizzy.

If you are lucky enough to be located near a pool, pond, lake or ocean, then <strong>run near, to or from, a body of water.</strong> A quick dip, mid or post run, will help regulate your body temperature, and feel amazing.

While you should <strong>always take a phone with you</strong>, anytime you expect situations to be extreme, you should absolutely take one with you. I understand wanting to escape from technology, but I have never been more grateful for it then the time I had to call my father to come get me when I started to black out during a run. It doesn’t have to be on, but it does need to be with you incase things go wrong.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post-Run</span></strong>

Congratulations, you have survived! Now, take care of yourself so you can get out there again tomorrow.

<strong>Cool off</strong> as soon as you can. Jump into a pool/lake/ocean, spray yourself down with the hose or put some cold packs on your neck, under your armpits and…down there. These are your bodies circulation centers, and a change in temperature hear will have the most noticeable effect on overall body temperature.

<strong>Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate.</strong> Your body can lose up to 2 ½ liters of water per hour during prolonged exercise, but it can only reabsorb about 1 liter per hour, which means that you need to continue rehydrating for a long time after you finish your run. Make sure you include a slightly salty liquid, <a href=" http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/nutrition/rws-complete-guide-to-hydration/1780.html">such as watered down Gatorade or equivalent sports drink</a>.

    <title>Freedom of the Hills Friday: First-Aid Kit</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[If there is one thing that you should always bring with you on an adventure, it should be your first-aid kit. First aid kits can be as basic as the bandaids and neosporin you have in you house, to a full Wilderness First Responder kit. However, neither of these are appropriate for you, the weekend adventurer.  You can easily buy a First-Aid kit from an outdoor store like <a href="http://www.ems.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=10754172">Eastern Mountain Sports</a> for $15-$60. It's good to have a bag or container that screams FIRST AID in case someone needs to find it for you! I bought a basic first aid kit from EMS and then supplemented it with a few additional neccesities. <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-04-at-9.26.48-AM.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-734" title="Screen shot 2012-05-04 at 9.26.48 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-04-at-9.26.48-AM.png" alt="" width="368" height="342" /></a>

Here is the list of things that should be in your First Aid Kit according to Freedom of the Hills. I've put a * next to what I have in mine:
<ul>
  <li>*Adhesive bandages</li>
  <li>*Butterfly bandages/Steristrips</li>
  <li>*Sterile gauze pads</li>
  <li>Carlisle bandage/sanitary napkin</li>
  <li>* Non-adherent dressing</li>
  <li>Self-adhering roller bandages</li>
  <li>SAM splint (malleable). I don't have one of these although I should. If worst came to worst, I would splint a bone with my ace bandage and some sticks, or use a sleeping pad if it were a leg. I highly reccomend taking a Wilderness First Aid course to practice these skills.</li>
  <li>*Athletic Tape</li>
  <li>*Triangular bandages</li>
  <li>*Moleskin/Molefoam</li>
  <li>Tincture of Benzoin<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-735" title="Screen shot 2012-05-04 at 9.27.05 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-04-at-9.27.05-AM-300x294.png" alt="" width="300" height="294" /></li>
  <li>*Providone-iodine swabs</li>
  <li>*Alcohol/Soap pads</li>
  <li>Thermometer</li>
  <li>Super packets</li>
  <li>*Asprin/acetaminophen</li>
  <li>Anaphylaxis kit (Epi Pen)</li>
  <li>Antihistamin</li>
  <li>*Elastic bandage (like an ACE bandage)</li>
  <li>*Latex or nitrile gloves</li>
  <li>Safety Pins</li>
  <li>Tweezers</li>
  <li>*Plastic bag for contaminated items</li>
  <li>*Disposable breathing barrier</li>
  <li>*Pen, Paper, accident report form.</li>
</ul>
In addition to what I said I have on this list, I also have a strong inhaler in my kit since I used to have sports induced asthma and I've found it useful for other people I've been hiking with as well. This list is pretty barebones, and many people bring much much more with them. Better to be safe than sorry! If you're going out on an adventure this weekend and don't have time to put one of these together, at least bring an Ace Bandage, some sports tape, and some latex gloves. They will help you get you out of some nasty situations.]]></content:encoded>

    <title>LL Bean Gore-Tex Mountain Treads Hiking Boots</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes down to essential pieces of gear, I would argue that there is no piece more fundamental than your hiking boots. Whether you’re hiking, climbing, rafting, or kayaking, you need your feet to get you there. A sturdy, comfortable, and waterproof pair of boots can make or break a trip; there’s nothing like a blister or wet feet to turn a good weekend bad.

[caption id="attachment_760" align="aligncenter" width="542" caption="And let me tell you, they really do mean it."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-02-at-4.51.09-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-760 " title="Screen shot 2012-06-02 at 4.51.09 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-02-at-4.51.09-PM.png" alt="" width="542" height="95" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">Growing up, my parents had bought me boots for our annual summer trips, but my mother was always of the opinion that I would “grow into” my boots. Needless to say I never quite enjoyed wearing them. They were either too big, too small, or too heavy. I didn’t even have a pair that fit when I came to college.</p>
For my first hiking trip with the Tufts Mountain Club as a freshman, I borrowed a pair from a friend of mine. We happened to be the same size, and as luck would have it, they fit me perfectly. It was life changing. I knew right then I had to have a pair of my own.

I started talking to other folks in the club, as well as friends and family, and soon learned about the glorious lifetime guarantee of LL Bean. My friend’s dad had owned the same pair of hiking boots for 40 years. Every time they got old or fell apart, LL Bean replaced them, no questions asked. Now that’s my kind of company.

[caption id="attachment_761" align="alignright" width="295" caption="They come in two different color schemes. I&#39;ve had both!"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-02-at-4.49.38-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-761" title="Screen shot 2012-06-02 at 4.49.38 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-02-at-4.49.38-PM.png" alt="" width="295" height="276" /></a>[/caption]

I drove up to Maine, to LL Bean’s flagship store, and scored myself an amazing pair of boots 30% off. Let me please introduce you to LL Bean’s Women’s Gore-Tex Mountain Treads, Mid-Cut. The average college student might gag at the price ($150) and even I was a little hesitant to pay $100 for them, but they have more than paid for themselves. Not only am I on my 3<sup>rd</sup> pair of these babies (the first ones I dropped in a fire and burned the sole off, the second one squished my toes), but I wear them more than any other shoe. The high ankle of the boot is not only crucial for people with weak ankles like myself, and they are waterproof all the way up the laces making it a breeze to cross rivers. I also wear them in the winter around campus as my snow/slush boots. The boots are sturdy and hold my foot well in place, and have awesome traction. They are also great for icier conditions, simply by putting on a pair of micro-spikes.

Going back to the price, even if I had paid $150, since I’m on pair 3, that’s only $50 per pair, and I’m sure that I will get at least a few more replacements out of them. Hands-down the best deal for a solid pair of boots.

-SL

ps: I have 3 male friends who have the Men's version of these boots. They are just a good and my friend's love them as much as I do.]]></content:encoded>

 Every one of us has a list. You know, that list you keep in the back of your head, or scribble down in a notebook somewhere that keeps track of all of the trips that you would like to do in your life. Whether it’s hiking the Appalachian Trail or Paragliding across Europe, we all have those dream trips that we would do if someone gave us the time, money, and perfect opportunity. As a student, I rarely have any of these luxuries. But this summer, for the first time in my life, I finally got to cross a trip off of my list.

The 11 mile hike along the Na Pali coast on the island of Kauai in Hawaii is the only land access to the

[caption id="attachment_776" align="alignright" width="293" caption="Hanging out on the beach at Kalalau."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_1529_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-776  " title="IMG_1529_2" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_1529_2-682x1024.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="439" /></a>[/caption]

gorgeous and powerful valley and beach of Kalalau. The hiking is rather difficult, although totally do-able in one day in order to reach the beach. Although Mike and I consider ourselves very fit and athletic, the trail goes up and down through countless valleys, and with full packs on, it makes for long day. The hike as well as the destination are breathtaking, and it is undeniably the most beautiful and incredible trip I’ve ever done. In what other place will you be rewarded with a million dollar view after every uphill section (and there were dozens). Once you arrive at Kalalau, you have your pick of campsites right along the beach, and you’re biggest decision is how close to the waterfall shower and naked hippies do you want to be? You heard me, naked hippies. Why do you think this trip was on my list?

Legend has it that this isolated valley used to be home to dozens of hippies who lived off the land and lived in a happy, naked paradise. My dad used to tell me that the farther into the hike you got, the less clothing people wore. He wasn’t exactly wrong. Not much has changed, although people are significantly more dressed than I assume they were in the 60’s and 70’s, but it is still common place to remove all clothing when in contact with any body of water (ocean, stream, or otherwise).

The trip isn’t in itself that strenuous or out of the reach of any relatively fit person. Heck, you don’t even need that much gear (or clothing), but rather it’s the fact that you can only do this hike in the summer, and the logistics of getting to the trail head in the first place the make this trip so elusive.

First you have to get yourself to Honolulu. I recommend spending a day or two there since no matter where you’re coming from you’re in for a long flight, and you’ll probably need a day or two to adjust to your jet-lag. Hawaii has a good amount of <a href="http://www.hawaiihostelsguide.com/">hostels</a> and a rather thorough bus system (beware, the buses run on Hawaiian Time so bring a book).

Next comes the fun part. If you are on a budget of time and money, like we were, you’re going to want to get on the trail as soon as possible. We caught the earliest flight out of Honolulu that you can on Hawaiian Air. It cost us about $230 roundtrip to get to Kauai and back to Honolulu.  We arrived in Lihue, Kauai at about 6:10 am and managed to just miss the airport shuttle that would take us to the bus stop. However,  an $8 cab got us to our bus stop in time where we caught a local bus (one of three on the island) all the way to Hanalei. It cost us $2 each, and hour of bus time, and plenty of dirty looks with our big packs and haole selves (haole=white person).

Once you get to Hanalei, you have a couple of options.

1) Hitch hike the 12 miles to the trailhead (it’s literally at the end of the road, you can’t miss it). This is probably your best option. People are so nice there and trust me, weirder people than you have tried to get to Kalalau.

2) Call ahead of time for a taxi (it’s a slow drive, so this might be costly)

3) Convince the local tour guides to hook you up with a ride

We managed to make a few calls ahead of time and happened to have a family friend in Kauai who kindly drove us to and picked us up from the trailhead (Emma, if you’re reading this, Mahalo Nui Loa!)

[caption id="attachment_779" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Our campsite."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-04-at-9.15.05-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-779" title="Screen shot 2012-06-04 at 9.15.05 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-04-at-9.15.05-AM-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a>[/caption]

Once I finally figured out the logistics of getting to and from the hike, we focused on our packing list. We decided to take 5 days to do the trip, which I would recommend as an absolute minimum. Everyone who only spent one or two nights there regretted it. I will list some of the crucial things we needed as well as some things to remember:

1) A water filter. Hawaii has leptospirosis. ‘Nough said.

2) A shelter with a bug net/rain fly. There are lots of mosquitoes and it will consistently shower almost every day. Hammocks were very popular there.

3) A stove. If you choose to do this, you will have to buy fuel at one of the local kayak shops in Hanalei since you can’t bring fuel on a plane.

4) Sunscreen, bug repellant (crucial), biodegradable soap. Remember &lt;3oz for a plane so either buy them in Hanalei, or check a small bag ($17 on Hawaiian Air). There is a huge Aloe plant by the composting toilets so if you get a burn, that will help a lot.

5) Basic trail food is good but I highly suggest, if you’re up for carrying the weight, bringing some booze. We carried in 3 liters of wine and some rum. Heavy as crap but totally worth it. We made friends real fast and never went hungry. Can you say Kalalau Pizza? Plus, our packs were super light on the way out!

6) Something to sleep on. I don’t say sleeping bag here because you don’t really need one. Mike had a sleeping bag liner and I put a towel over my sleeping pad and used my nylon hammock as a sheet when I wanted it. We were more than comfortable.

[caption id="attachment_784" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Hanakapi&#39;ai Fall and swimming pool"]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-04-at-9.16.08-AM2.png"><img class=" wp-image-784  " title="Screen shot 2012-06-04 at 9.16.08 AM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-04-at-9.16.08-AM2.png" alt="" width="240" height="369" /></a>[/caption]

Remember, you don’t really need a lot. A light fleece might be nice, but the temperature stays pretty stable during the summer. I also recommend a book or playing cards if you plan on staying for more than 3 or 4 nights.  Michael and I had 40L and 50L packs respectively, which was plenty of room. We saw people hiking with 80L packs and they looked miserable

A few last tips:

There is a campsite at Hanakoa which is 5 miles from Kalalau. I highly recommend doing what we did, which is hiking the extra 4 miles into Hanakapi’ai falls, and then if you run out of daylight or are tired later, you can easily camp at Hanakoa.

    <title>Barefoot Running: A Shoeless Investigation</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the fitness trends that I've been keeping an eye on for a few years has been the rise of barefoot runners. Unless you've been under a rock for the past couple of years, you're probably familiar with Christopher McDougall, or at least his recent best seller <em>Born to Run.</em> After years of running and multiple injuries later, he had doctors tell him that he would need to replace his knees and hips. It was then that he discovered the Tarahumara Indians in the Copper Canyon of Mexico. They were a people that could run hundreds of miles at a time in thin rubber sandals without ever getting hurt. What he learned from them was that the debate on barefoot running is not necessarily about the footwear, but about how you run.

[caption id="attachment_798" align="alignright" width="350" caption="There are all different styles of minimalist or barefoot running shoes out these days."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5094.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-798 " title="5094" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5094.jpeg" alt="" width="350" height="215" /></a>[/caption]

As someone who suffers from a chronic sprain in my left ankle and wicked tight hips, I was an easy sell. I untied my Asics and took off for a jog. I quit a mile later, not wanting to hurt myself, which was probably the right choice as I was sore for days. The tops of my feet as well as the lower area of my calves ached and made me realize that these were areas of my body I didn't normally use when I run.
<div>Intrigued, but not yet convinced, I set out to learn more by doing some investigating around campus and, like any good college student, by watching a lot of YouTube videos.</div>
Barefoot running has gathered a huge following in the past few years, with multiple shoe companies like Nike and Vibrams picking up on the trend. Die-hard fans claim that running without shoes is not only more natural, but over all beneficial to the human body. Even those who still prefer the ol’ sneaker see the benefits of running barefoot as a training tool to make you a more conscious runner.

“[Running barefoot] is a great regulator,” McDougall said. “You can’t over pronate [rotating your feet inward], you can’t over train, you can’t over stride. If you’re in the middle of a run and your feet start to hurt, you’re done for the day.”

With the hundreds of models of running shoes available today, it seems almost ludicrous to ignore all of the biomechanical engineering that goes into making a shoe that is designed to make you run faster. But according to the barefoot-enthusiasts, these highly engineered shoes are where the problem started.

Think of your current pair of running shoes. They probably have nice think rubber soles to absorb the shock of the ground and nice arch support. These features, however, have lead us to change our natural stride. The built in arch for example makes the muscles in the arch of your foot lazy and may in turn cause you more problems in the long run. Instead of striking with the heel, barefoot runners land on the forefront of their foot and then bring the heel down. This in fact decreases the impact to the body and is over all more efficient. (Have you ever been called a heel-striker? I have. I need new friends.)

[caption id="attachment_797" align="alignright" width="232" caption="You&#39;d be stoked too if you ran Ragnar in Vibrams."]<a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-13-at-1.17.50-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-797" title="Screen shot 2012-06-13 at 1.17.50 PM" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-13-at-1.17.50-PM.png" alt="" width="232" height="501" /></a>[/caption]

When he’s not running barefoot, Simon, a Tufts student, and a few of his friends wear these five-finger shoes during the day. You may have started to see more and more students around campus replacing their converses with Vibrams.

“As a runner, I had chronic shin splints all through high school,” said Simon. His friend, Joshua Elliott, used to have tendinitis and arch pain as well. Similar to McDougall, their injuries have disappeared every since they switched to Vibrams.

“I swear by these things,” said Elliott. “I would prefer to be barefoot but in many public places you are required to wear shoes so by wearing Vibrams, it’s like I’ve found a loophole.”

This back to barefoot approach, however, may not be for everyone.

Patricia Cordeiro, a sports therapist at Tufts walks to work everyday in a pair of Vibrams.

“From a professional standpoint I don't think that everyone can run in them,” said Cordeiro. “There are certain people (like myself) who have certain biomechanical issues who require an orthotic or motion control shoe for running.” Cordeiro, like many others, see barefoot running as a good training and strengthening tool.

“I noticed an increase in lower leg strength especially in my feet and toes I never had before,” she said. “The first time I wore them for a 15 min. walk home from the T and my legs were sore the next day...even though I had been biking 50-60 miles, running 5-15 miles and swimming a ton already. I think all athletes would benefit from barefoot training each day in order to strengthen the smaller muscles in their feet and it might decrease the number of people we see with foot, lower leg and knee pain.”

I don't know which group, heel or non-heel strikers, is right, although I do know that I've started to get in a barefoot run every now and then, and that I haven't sprained my ankle in a while. Nonetheless, I'm not a total convert, vanity mostly, so I think I'll stick to my Asics for now.]]></content:encoded>

    <title>5 Running Gear Essentials</title>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[As a student paying an expensive private college tuition, I keep a strict budget. I’ve learned to live and entertain myself on the dime, and that’s one of the reasons I find running the perfect sport. Just spend about a $100 on a pair of shoes, and you’re good to go. No special costly gear needed.

But in all my training, through hours and hours, miles and miles, there are certain things that are just really nice to have, especially over long distances. These are a few pieces of gear that I’ve  learned help out, even more so in hot weather.

<strong>A roller:</strong> It’s like a mini-massage after every run. Great for getting out knots and easing sore muscles, which is especially nice when you are logging serious milage daily. I even find them nice before a run to refresh muscles.

<strong><a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/armband1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-815 alignright" src="http://www.collegeoutside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/armband1-300x221.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></a>iPod armband:</strong> Up until the middle of my half marathon, I was determined not to buy an armband. I only had a case and would only ever hold my iPod or tuck it in my clothes. So this is what I did for my half. Then at mile 8 my music stopped playing because it got wet (it had suffered some Gatorade splashes, water splashes, cool-down water mists, and general sweat). I finally dried it and got it to work again, but those few minutes of mild panic was when I decided yeah, an armband is probably a good investment. I encourage you not to make the same mistake I did.

<strong>Anti-chafe balm:</strong> This prevents any irritation due to the combination of sweat, heat and repeated rubbing during a long race. This is good for underarms, chest, and legs.

<strong>A safety light/reflective belt:</strong> To beat the heat, I, like others, tend to run after dark. Accordingly, it’s important to be very visible, even if your route keeps you on sidewalks. You will eventually encounter some unobservant driver who stops in the middle of a crosswalk or blindly pulls out of their driveway. A bright flashing light will make sure they see you.

<strong>A great pair of shoes, fitted and matched just for you:</strong> I've heard many new runners try to find a bargain online or buy the fanciest shoes without even trying them on, and then end up unsatisfied with their shoes. I suggest you go to your local running specialty store, get your stride and gait analyzed, and get the pair of shoes perfectly suited to you. Don’t shop online, don’t go to a general athletics store, just enjoy the advice of a store staffed by experienced knowledgeable runners. If they don’t recommend the cheapest pair or even the fanciest pair, trust them, test them out in store, and buy a pair of shoes you know you’ll love for hundreds of miles.

What pieces of gear will you not leave on your run without?]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[So you’re brand new to all this outdoors stuff - climbing, hiking, biking, etc. - and all the gear that goes along with it. It’s ok, I was just there too, and I’m here to help!  Today's focus is climbing gear, though there are posts about hiking and cycling to come.  Between sizing, safety, pricing, and, of course, coolness, there is a lot to think about with these sports.  Here are a few of my tips!

This may seem odd, but <strong>Tip #1 is : Don’t buy the gear!</strong>

Well, let me be more specific - don’t buy it yet.  Gear is expensive.  It’s important to be sure that you are going to stick with the sport in order for your investment to pay off.  Paying $60 (and thats on the low end!) for a harness you only use twice isn’t worth it on a college student’s budget.  Second, borrowing friends’ gear will give you a great product testing period.  You can see what you do and don’t like before putting down the money yourself.  With these ideas in mind, I suggest waiting until your friends are absolutely sick of you borrowing their gear or until you're going so often that your adventure time is being limited by your access to the gear.  Those are both pretty good indicators that it's time to make the investment.

So now you think you’re ready to buy your own gear.  Here is <strong>Tip #2: Be strategic about the order in which you buy things.</strong>

Note: NOT recommended.[/caption]

For climbing this means you should get shoes, a harness, and an ATC first.  Helmet and chalk bag can come second. If you are really stretching it, I would say shoes are the first thing to buy.  They're the most difficult to borrow, given differences in sizes, whereas harnesses are adjustable.  As for helmets, you may look silly for a few outings, but you can easily use a bike or ski helmet in lieu of a climbing helmet.  If you are climbing in the gym, helmets won’t even be necessary.

<strong>Tip # 3: Use discount/flash sale gear sites.</strong>

A list of these can be found <a href="http://www.collegeoutside.com/how-to-fill-your-gear-closet-without-going-broke-part-ii/">here</a>.  If you're willing to be a little patient, you can find almost any piece of gear you want on sale.  Especially if you’re looking in the off-season.

There you have it.  The top three things I recommend doing before you go make your first gear purchase.  Happy climbing!]]></content:encoded>
